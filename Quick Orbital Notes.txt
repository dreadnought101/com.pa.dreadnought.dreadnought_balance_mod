Orbital notes

Orbital Celestial Movements between planets
-Adjusted orbital speeds to match live patch (were originally slower)
-Nukes/Unit cannons/fighters/legion scouts hemogenized
-Astraeus/Avenger/Hermes and Legion variants Chariot/Viper/Spectre will move faster than regular orbital units 
  >System_Velocity increased 30.0 to 36.0
  >Gravwell increased 10.0 to 12.0


Base specs state 
    "planetary_arrival_cooldown_time": 3.0,  !!
    "gravwell_velocity_multiplier": 3.0,
    "system_velocity_multiplier": 15.0,
   
(ONLY Astraeus, Hermes, and orbital fabs have system-multiplyers)

Gravwell average seems to be manually set for the most part at 6.0
Many System Velocity units are auto-given at 15.0.

System-Multi affects units using the sun to move between planets.
Gravwell_veloc affects units moving between planets, even if it uses a 2nd planet to get to a 3rd.

Excluding Astraeus, Hermes, and Avengers which will play by their own targets, my total target is 6.0 and 15.0 are the baseline

~~My Balance adjustments

--Considerations

Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Increase Umbrella weapon speed (1000), and missile projectile (catapult/stingray/bluehawk) speeds.  Been meaning to increase missile projectiles for a while alongside hornets (also nerf hornet projectile speed) and this is a nice crossover

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.


--Done

Base Orbital 
Gravwell 10.0
System_velocity 30.0

Orbital Navigation (Increases arrival spread to a planet)
-"orbital_arrival_radius": 100, to 300
-"orbital_arrival_unit_radius": 7.5, to 22.5
-"planetary_arrival_cooldown_time": has been increased from 3.0 to 4.0 for most units, and 2.0 for Avenger/Hermes/Astraeus
-Most units have been hemogenized to have identical movement between planets with some exceptions.
>Hermes and Nuke remains extremely fast
>Avenger/Astraeus have been increased to be faster than normal
>Solar array has been increased to average speed
>Unit Cannon has been slowed to average speed
>Orbital Fab/ARKYD/Artemis/SXX/Omega/Advanced Radar/Helios/T2 Air fighter remain unchanged

-System multiplier 10.0 to 16.75
-gravwell multiplier 5.0 to 7.0
-Orbital Arrival delay reduced 3.0 to 2.0
(Orbital Movement has been increased roughly 20% from slower than other orbital units to faster)

Anchor 
-150 orbital range 150 to 200 (25%)

Hermes
-Speed/brake/accel 75 to 100
-Orbital Arrival delay reduced 3.0 to 2.0

-weapon projectile speed - 300 to 400
-Orbital Arrival delay reduced 3.0 to 2.0
(gets 3 shot by other avengers, 1 shot by everything else anti-orbital, next minimum is Omega at 65x2=130 [my version 45x2=90] and anchors at 200, Umbrella is 100)
