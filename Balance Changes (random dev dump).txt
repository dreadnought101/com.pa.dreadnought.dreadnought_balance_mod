--Todo when mods get fixed

(Added AOE to overlooked AA units to be homogenized with stingers and spinners from previous patch)

(Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something else, which at current range is a few units past the target)

(Makes drifters more punishable by ants if caught, making the exchange 3 for 3 both ways.)
