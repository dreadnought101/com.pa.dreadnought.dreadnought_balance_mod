--EZ STUFF

Hummingbird air fighter
decrease weapon damage from 80 to 70 [now 75 to 70] (3 shots instead of 2 to kill)

~Omega (Advanced Orbital)
(Dev Idea: Make them actually counter avengers)
-Add splash to anti-orbital weapons (2x65 damage every 1.00 seconds)
--Full Damage radius: 1
--Splash: 10x2 damage, radius 3

~Horseflies
-Horseflies can shoot air
-Horseflies (Add command assist and change break rate for old micro)
-nerf health and damage maybe

-jig explosion (building only)

~Ares
-Ground pound AOE only affects structures

--HARD STUFF

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which well have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)

add 4 individual weapons to pheonix for cleave

Icarus changes
Add different weapon type (same ammo drain) for air
Increase air weapon version to much further range
maybe decrease ground range from 80 to 70
Ground damage 20
Air damage 30

~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else



CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Lob revamp
-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Icarus revamp to have seperate air and ground weapons,
-Omega AOE component
- Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes
-Hummingbird nerfs, Pheonix cleave changes
