--TODO

Improve turn rate of orbital to orbital turrets on Imperator

Deathmark+Scorpion speed increase 8 to 10.  Perhaps a small range decrease to Scorpion to compensate


Reduce bomber speed, projectile? Also make it work in naval (orbital thing)

Transport reduction?

Reduce T1 turret significantly perhaps in cost/damage

Buff that locust spawn thingy speed

Change T1 AA structure to not target icarus...add AOE?

Catfish change laser guns to projectiles (perhaps more of an arc 

Advanced Torp changes perhaps


Odin has 20 splash radius (20 damage down from 40) of AA...wat

AA Icarus Removals (So far) - Odin, Lynx, Patriot, Orbweaver, Panzer

(Interestingly Praetorian wasn't updated like the Colonel.  It also shoots twice as fast for half damage, and at 110 range compared to colonel's 100 range.  ALso has 90 turn rate to colonel's 180)
