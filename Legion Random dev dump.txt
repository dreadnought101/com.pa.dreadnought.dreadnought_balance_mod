-Build range increased 35 to 45 [Vanilla 30 to 45]
-Weapon Range increased 115 to 125 [Vanilla 110]


--TODO



Deathmark+Scorpion speed increase 8 to 10.  Perhaps a small range decrease to Scorpion to compensate


Reduce bomber speed, projectile? Also make it work in naval (orbital thing)

Transport reduction?

Reduce T1 turret significantly perhaps in cost/damage

Buff that locust spawn thingy speed

Change T1 AA structure to not target icarus...add AOE?

Catfish change laser guns to projectiles (perhaps more of an arc 

Advanced Torp changes perhaps


Odin has 20 splash radius (20 damage down from 40) of AA...wat
