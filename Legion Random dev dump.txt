--DONE

OmniSilo
-Energy storage increased 200,000 to 225,000
(Matches recent Legion patch)

T2 Air Stealth Scout
-Removed my own changes to update with Legion's recent base changes

Orbital Fab
-Metal Cost 1300 to 1100
-Metal build rate reduced 45 to 37
-Energy draw reduced 1500 to 1250
(Helps Legion get into Starcannon tech. Build rate reduced below 38 equivelent number as compensation)

Starcannon 
-Remove all T2 units (Fabs+Scorpion+Orbweaver)
-Remove Some T1 units (Shank, Maul)
-14 Capacity to 20
-Metal Cost reduced 2400 to 650
-Health reduced 3000 to 600
-Roll-off delay reduced 4.0 to 2.0
-Ground Vision reduced 150 to 100
-Metal Build rate 45 to 18
-Energy Draw 2250 to 700
(The cheaper cost compared to the Lob's 1200 is due to orbital launchers costing 1000, and orb fabbers at 1300.  I also feel starcannon power will be reduced over time so late game spamming isn't as big an issue)




--TODO






Reduce bomber speed, projectile? Also make it work in naval (orbital thing)

Transport reduction?

Reduce T1 turret significantly perhaps in cost/damage

Buff that locust spawn thingy speed

Change T1 AA structure to not target icarus...add AOE?

Catfish change laser guns to projectiles (perhaps more of an arc 

Advanced Torp changes perhaps


Odin has 20 splash radius (20 damage down from 40) of AA...wat

AA Icarus Removals (So far) - Odin, Lynx, Patriot, Orbweaver, Panzer

(Interestingly Praetorian wasn't updated like the Colonel.  It also shoots twice as fast for half damage, and at 110 range compared to colonel's 100 range.  ALso has 90 turn rate to colonel's 180)
