--DONE

Legion Air Fab
-Health 90 to 120
-speed 35 to 32 (+accel/break)
-Metal cost 225 to 245
-Build rate 9 to 11
-energy draw 800 to 975
(Makes it more unique compared to MLA air fabs with the general concept of concept of costing more, building better.  However I think I'll be looking at speed across the board as that can massively impact a unit and pacing in the early stages)

Purger (T1 Boombot)
-HP 20 to 10
-Speed 30 to 35
-Metal 50 to 60
-Vision 50 to 85 (+85 vision in ammo utility+death)
-Death Jump range 40 to 30 (Utility jump untouched)
(Legion having vision on units where the other factions dont? Lets go!)

Peacekeeper (T1 Bot)
-Movespeed 15 to 18
-vision 105 to 100
-damage 19.5 to 18
-Projectile speed reduced 150 to 130 (Muzzle/Max Velocity)
(Peacekeepers were balanced towards 18 speed dox originally, and now have to keep up with 20 speed dox, as well as whatever bugs is throwing around)

Lancer (T1 Bot)
-Health reduced 120 to 90
-vision 100 to 130
-166 damage to 165   (???) 
-Fire-rate 0.61 to 0.38 (Fires 1 every 2.63 secons - 105 dps to 63) 
-range increased 70 to 75
(100 dps on a 150 metal unit is insane.  Making it more burst orientated.  I want range higher than peacekeeper's 70 in order to maintain the combo identity and help lancers stay behind peacekeepers)

Orbweaver (T2 Bot AA)
-HP 400 to 300
-4x20 damage to 4x12 (20 to +12 splash)
-range 140 to 110
-AOE increased 10 to 15
(These seem like giga-nerfs until you realize this unit costs 750 and is hitscan AOE.  I would like to increase its AOE, but sacrifice raw punching damage)

Panzer (T2 Armor...something)
-Move Speed 14 to 10
-cost 1200 to 1900
-Health 200 to 1300
-Vision 100 to 200
-Removed Weapon Ground/Sea. -Added AA.  
-Removed 0.5 Orbital damage modifier
-range 180 to 240
-Projectile lifetime increased 5.5 to 7.5
-damage 50x6 to 75x6
-Changed Ammo type from time to energy (essentially added two 0s to capacity/demand/ammo_per_shot)
-Reduced fire-rate from 1.5 to 1.0
-Ammo_capacity 6 to 2000
-Ammo_demand 1 to 200
-Ammo_per_shot 2 to 1000
-Switched Carpet modes off
-Gave it air targetting priorities (it will target transports+bombers+gunships+titans, but will randomly choose between orbital and air afterwards)
(Weapon works by firing 2 shots within 2 seconds, but then fires 1 shot every 5 seconds, can bank 2 shots)
(I want to try a tanky single target T2 AA. I also think Armor has so many units that attack ground, and this just cluttered their roster. Its also at 1900 metal cost, much higher than any other T2 AA)


--TODO









Comet (Demi-Titan teleporter)
-Metal cost 4000 to 1000
-HP 1900 to 3800

Increase air fab buildrate+cost+slight hp buff

Nerf that marauder

Reduce bomber speed, projectile? Also make it work in naval (orbital thing)

Transport reduction?

Reduce T1 turret significantly perhaps in cost/damage

Buff that locust spawn thingy speed

Change T1 AA structure to not target icarus...add AOE?

Catfish change laser guns to projectiles (perhaps more of an arc 

Advanced Torp changes perhaps


Odin has 20 splash radius (20 damage down from 40) of AA...wat

AA Icarus Removals (So far) - Odin, Lynx, Patriot, Orbweaver, Panzer

(Interestingly Praetorian wasn't updated like the Colonel.  It also shoots twice as fast for half damage, and at 110 range compared to colonel's 100 range.  ALso has 90 turn rate to colonel's 180)





Nerf guardian health/build rate perhaps
