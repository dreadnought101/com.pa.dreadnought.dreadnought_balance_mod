FULL LEGION CHANGES

Commander
-Move Speed 6 to 8
-Torpedo damage vs comms 50%
-Uber cannon 72% against structures (25% against comms unchanged) 

Praetorian (Support Commander)
-Cost reduced 7000 to 6500
-Build range increased 30 to 35
-Turn in place set to true 
-Turn speed 90 to 180 
-(Health unchanged at 8000)
(Interestingly Praetorian wasn't updated like the Colonel.  It also shoots twice as fast for half damage, and at 110 range compared to colonel's 100 range.  Added turn rate/break rate/turn in place for Quality of Life)

Patriot (T1 Bot AA)  
-Metal cost 100 to 150
-Health 100 to 120
-Move speed 15 to 14
-Vision Radius 100 to 90
-Increased Model size by 50%
-Damage 25 to 35
-Bullet Lifetime 1.0 to 1.2
-Added 1.5 splash radius
-Rate of fire increased 4 to 5
-Fires 3 shots a salvo.  Takes 3.6 seconds to recharge.  Does not recharge while firing
-Range 100 to 190
-DPS aprox 27

Purger (T1 Boombot)
-HP 20 to 10
-Speed 30 to 35
-Metal 50 to 60
-Vision 50 to 85 (+85 vision in ammo utility+death)
-Death Jump range 40 to 30 (Utility jump untouched)
(Legion having vision on units where the other factions dont? Lets go!)

Peacekeeper (T1 Bot)
-Movespeed 15 to 18
-vision 105 to 100
-damage 19.5 to 18
-Projectile speed reduced 150 to 130 (Muzzle/Max Velocity)
(Peacekeepers were balanced towards 18 speed dox originally, and now have to keep up with 20 speed dox, as well as whatever bugs is throwing around)

Lancer (T1 Bot)
-Health reduced 120 to 90
-vision 100 to 130
-166 damage to 165 (???)
-Fire-rate 0.61 to 0.38 (Fires 1 every 2.63 secons - 105 dps to 63)
-range increased 70 to 75
(100 dps on a 150 metal unit is insane. Making it more burst orientated. I want range higher than peacekeeper's 70 in order to maintain the combo identity and help lancers stay behind peacekeepers)

Orbweaver (T2 Bot AA)
-HP 400 to 300
-4x20 damage to 4x12 (20 to +12 splash)
-range 140 to 110
-AOE increased 10 to 20
(These seem like giga-nerfs until you realize this unit costs 750 and is hitscan AOE. I would like to increase its AOE, but sacrifice raw punching damage)

Corsair (T1 Vehicle Artillery)
-Partial Splash radius reduced 10 to 5
-Full Splash radius reduced 2 to 1

Added Lynx as an anti-air armor (T1 Vehicle AA)
-Health 155
-Metal Cost 170
-Speed 13
-Vision 100
Lynx Weapon fires a salvo of 2 shots near instantly, then 1 shot every 0.5 seconds
-25 damage (Splash radius 1.5)
-Range 110
-Velocity 200
-Ammo capacity 1
-Ammo drain per shot 0.5
-Rate of fire 4.0 (fires 4 shots a second [however ammo recharge makes the Lynx fire twice a second after initial salvo])
-Gave Lynx standard Air Targetting priorities (focuses transports, bombers, gunships first)

Scythe (T1 Air Fighter)
-Firing arc increased 89 to 105
-Health increased 120 to 150 [MLA 120 to 150]
-damage increased 29x2 to 32x2 
(Helps maintain the 3 shot ratio of Scythe against Corsair and added slight QOL in arc radius with regular Legion arc overhaul)

Marauder (T1 Gunship)
-Health 50 to 20
-Vision 250 to 200
-Range 60 to 50
(The fact this gunship has 100 speed with huge vision allows it to operate independently is crazy, however its 240 cost [compared to Icarus 125] is significant but this will still allow fast and attentative Legion players to pick off undefended fabs/raiding forces and hopefully not nerf it too much but keep it balanced)

Bowhead (T1 Naval Battleship)
-Adjusted turret positions to face directly left/right
-Adjusted yaw range from 120 to 135 [turrets can turn further]

Akula (T1 Naval Sub)
-Firing arc increased 60 to 360
-Torpedo turn rate reduced 120 to 75 (Lifetime 4.0)
(This helps Akulas be utilized as the model is difficult to view at a glance where it is pointed and if its firing. The turn rate and lifetime makes it difficult to hit things from behind)

Catfish (T1 Naval Raider)
-Changed from Deepwater to water-hover
-Torpedo damage reduced 250 to 150
(Allows Legion to function on maps with shallows, as well as handle stoke spam that plagues Legion v Legion games. Torpedo reduction is compensation)

Panzer (T2 Armor...something)
-Move Speed 14 to 10
-cost 1200 to 1900
-Health 200 to 1300
-Vision 100 to 200
-Removed Weapon Ground/Sea. -Added AA.
-Removed 0.5 Orbital damage modifier
-range 180 to 240
-Projectile lifetime increased 5.5 to 7.5
-damage 50x6 to 75x6
-Changed Ammo type from time to energy (essentially added two 0s to capacity/demand/ammo_per_shot)
-Reduced fire-rate from 1.5 to 1.0
-Ammo_capacity 6 to 2000
-Ammo_demand 1 to 200
-Ammo_per_shot 2 to 1000
-Switched Carpet modes off
-Gave it air targetting priorities (it will target transports+bombers+gunships+titans, but will randomly choose between orbital and air afterwards)
(Weapon works by firing 2 shots within 2 seconds, but then fires 1 shot every 5 seconds, can bank 2 shots)
(I want to try a tanky single target T2 AA. I also think Armor has so many units that attack ground, and this just cluttered their roster. Its also at 1900 metal cost, much higher than any other T2 AA)

Firebird (T2 Air Fighter) 
-Health decreased 240 to 225 [MLA 240 to 225]

Comet (Demi-Titan teleporter)
-Metal cost 4000 to 8000
-HP 1900 to 4000
(Delays the timing of Comets for invasions but makes them last longer when they actually arive to a planet. Interestingly, their planetary arrival cooldown is 8.0 seconds, far above the 3/4 seconds of everything else)

Thor (Walker Titan)
-Thor health increased 60000 to 95000
-Thor Movespeed increased 11 to 13
-Cannon range reduced 400 to 270
-Cannon damage reduced 2x600 to 2x200 (+splash)
-Cannon firerate increased 3.03 to 2 seconds per shot
-Cannon splash radius reduced 15 to 5
-Laser range reduced 250 to 200
-Laser damage reduced 175 to 100 (+splash 150 to 100)
-Laser splash radius reduced 5 to 0.5
-Laser spread fire set to true
-Missile Range increased 170 to 180
-Missile splash radius reduced 12 to 5
-Missile damage increased 100x16 to 140x16 (+splash 100 to 140)
-Missile Firerate increased from 11.11 to 8.0 seconds per shot
-Crush damage (Stomp) reduced 500 to 400
-Crush damage only damages buildings. 
-Crush damage fire rate increased 0.76 to 0.5 (fires more often
(Dev Note: I want to increase Thor's ability to survive and tank on the frontline as an assault bot, and in turn reduce its damage so a singular thor cant wipe out armies but allows supporting armies to do the damage for it)

Odin (Armor Titan)
-Health 50000 to 45000
-Main gun damage decreased 5600 to 4900
-Main gun AOE reduced 30 to 20 (partial damage 600, full damage radius reduced 10 to 5)
-Odin stomp/crush now deals full structure to buildings, and aprox 0.1% or 2-3 damage to nearby units.
-Increased crush fire-rate from 1 to 2 attacks a second [Same as Ares, and now matches its dps as well]
(Note 1: I enjoy the crush mechanics of the Ares and Odin. I think it should do inconsequential damage to nearby units, but be significant against structures.  
Note 2: I also decreased its health, but tweeked damage as compensation for Ares vs Odin matchups so that the Ares wins when using secondary guns but loses when it does not. Note 3: I decreased main damage radius and partial damage so that targetting high health targets matter more, but increased partial damage radius for now as compensation, however I may nerf it if the Odin performs too well against T2 compositions compared to Ares)

Sputnik (Orbital Radar)
-Speed/break/accel 15 to 20

Paladin (Advanced orbital railgun)
-Speed 30 to 50 (brake/accel 10 to 20)
-350 range to 450

Black Knight (Orbital to ground laser)
-Speed/break/accel 20 to 40 
-(Interestingly, the black-knight has a dedicated cooldown time of 5.0 seconds above regular default 3.0.  My default is 4.0)

Imperator (Orbital battleship)
-Speed 20 to 30 (brake 80 to 120, acceleration 30 to 45)
[MLA Speed 15 to 25, brake/accel same]
-Metal Cost 14000 to 12500
-Orbital Beam Weapons damage (3x) 65x1 damage to 45x1 
-Orbital Beam Weapons Firerate decreased 1.0 to 0.75 
-Orbital Beam Weapons can target ground targets (Will prioritise orbital first)
-Orbital Beam Weapons pitch range increased 60 to 92.5
-Main anti-ground beam-gun can now targets seafloor units.
(May increase range of the large orbital gun and figure out what its purpose is)

--Structures and Fabricators

Orbital Fab
-Metal Cost 1300 to 1100
-Metal build rate reduced 45 to 37
-Energy draw reduced 1500 to 1250
(Helps Legion get into Starcannon tech. Build rate reduced below 38 equivelent number as compensation)

Orbital Launcher
-Metal cost increased 600 to 1000

Orbital Factory
-Metal cost reduced 6000 to 4000
-Build rate increased 60 to 72
-Energy demand increased 2000 to 2400

-Energy Draw 2250 to 700
(The cheaper cost compared to the Lob's 1200 is due to orbital launchers costing 1000, and orb fabbers at 1300. I also feel starcannon power will be reduced over time so late game spamming isn't as big an issue)

Rig
-HP increased 3000 to 6000

-Removed 3750 Energy Production
-Added 10,000 metal storage

-Adv Vessel metal 2700 to 2500  
            range 45 to 50

All Advanced Factories
