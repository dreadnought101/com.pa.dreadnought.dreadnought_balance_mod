FULL MLA BASE CHANGES STRUCTURES/FABS

~Barnacle (T1 Naval)
-build range increased 65 to 95
  (Dev Idea:  allows it to repair more safely and consistently)

~Stitch (Combat Fab)
-Increased health from 50 to 65
  (Dev Idea: Lets them take 2 stray shots from grenadier and slightly bulks up the unit but is still fragile to most things directly)

~Naval Basic Fabricator
-Health increased 100 to 200
-Move speed increased 10 to 12
  (Dev Note: The naval fab has less health than the vehicle fab at 200, despite costing more, having less speed, and more threatening enemy units, not to mention T2 naval fab has more health than T2 vehicle)
(Dev Note2: Allows for faster openings to cut down on the slow nature of early naval, as well as be less punishing when killing fabs that are far away from a factory spawn point

~Naval Advanced Fabricator
-Build range increased 30 to 50
-Changed deepwater to water-hover
  (Dev Note: This is mostly intended to be a quality of life change to help the adv ship build structures on land, as it does not have water-hover and can't get as close to shore as its basic naval fabricator counterpart)

~Advanced Fabricators [Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval] 
~Bot - 1800 to 1700
~Vehicle - 2025 to 1900
~Air - 2200 to 2075
~Naval - 2400 to 2225
~Each can now build all types of Titans [Atlas/Ares/Zues]
  (Dev Idea: Quality of life change, most players just relied on orbital fabs to build the desired titan)
(Dev Note: Metal cost reduced rougly 10% across the board, more favoring naval, slightly less favoring bot)

~Solar Array (Advanced Orbital energy producer)
-HP Increase 1000 to 6000
-Metal cost increased 1600 to 5000
-Energy production increased 3200/s to 9000/s
-Added 100,000 energy storage (from 0)
  (Dev Idea: Solar-power is GREEN! and best!  Basically this is the T3 energy producer, much like the Jig)

~Jig (Orbital Gas Giant Extractor)
-Removed 3,750 energy production (to 0)
-Jig Explosion mainly affects buildings (units take 4 damage, structures take 4000)
  (Dev Idea: Refocuse orbital energy production to Solar Arrays, Jigs cover to many roles and are strong for their value)

~Energy Storage
-HP Reduced from 7500 to 5000
-Metal Cost reduced 450 to 250
-Storage increased 300,000 to 250,000
  (Dev Idea: Decrease cost so its easier to build earlier on)

Advanced Metal Extractor (T2 Economy)
-Health increased 3000 to 5000
-Metal production decreased 18 to 17
(Dev Note: I think production is slightly too strong, but at 1800 metal cost, it should have some strong health for its heavy investment

~Galata (T1 AA structure)
-Increased AA Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

~Single Laser Defense Tower (1 barrel)
-Metal Cost decreased 225 to 165
-Health Decreased 400 to 350
-Range decreased 100 to 90
-Damage decreased 60 to 35
-Vision radius (+underwater vision) reduced from 130 to 110
  (Dev Idea: Adds more support against dox/strykers early game but is vulnerable to stronger T1 units, now 2 shots dox like it 2 shots strykers)

~Lob (T1 Defense Structure)
-Fire rate increased 3 to 4.5
-Metal Cost per shot increased 50 to 60
-Ammo capacity increased 445 to 500
-Ammo demand increased 13 to 15
-Uses Squals (Drone) instead of Dox
  (Dev Idea: Turns the lob into a proper defensive structure instead of a makeshift factory.  Will likely change squal's effectivness or cost soon.
Update:  Uses old numbers before april balance patch)

~Advanced Laser Defense Tower (T2 Defense Structure - triple barrel)
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 875
-Health increased 4000 to 3500
-Range increased 130 to 135
-Damage increased 150 to 200
-Fire-rate decreased 5.0 to 3.5
  (Dev Idea: I feel this turret obsoletes other turrets with its fire-rate, and would prefer it hurt higher health targets, while mass attacks favors a comprehensive turret line)

~Flak Cannon (T2 AA)
-HP reduced 2000 to 1700
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 750
-Range increased 120 to 150
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Advanced Torpedo Launcher (T2)
-metal cost reduced 1000 to 950
-range increased 210 to 300
-Rate of fire decreased 2.5 to 2.0/s
-torpedo lifetime increased 5 to 7
-Vision radius increased from 210 to 260
-Underwater vision radius increased 200 to 260
-Radar radius increased 210 to 310
-Sonar radius increased 210 to 310
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Advanced Radar (T2)
-Added 100 radius jamming
(Dev Comment: Allows T2 radar to have a unique impact compared to spamming T1 Radar or having orbital radar. Also increases decision making in placement and can give consideration to building more than 1-2 of these in a game)

~Orbital Launcher (T1)
-Cost increased 600 to 1000

~Orbital Factory
-Cost reduced 6000 to 4000
  (Dev Note: The reduction is quite high, but still accounts for 1000 launcher, and 1300 orbital fab, and the units themselves are mostly cost-prohibitive to get early. I'm hesitant to reduce it all the way to 3600 though)

~T2 factories. (Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval)
-All Advanced Factory costs reduced from 4800 to 4400

Adv Bot Factory
-Metal Build Rate increased 45 to 60
Energy draw per second 1500 to 1800
30 energy per metal
Roll off timer increased 3 seconds to 5

Adv Vehicle Factory
Metal build rate (60) unchanged
Energy 2025 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 4 to 6.5

Adv Air Factory
Metal 45 to 60
Energy 1500 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 2 to 5

Adv Naval Factory
Metal 60 to 72
Energy 1750 to 2015
28 E/M
Roll off time - 6 to 9

(Dev Note: I'm looking to have factories work better on their own without having to rely heavily on boosting, but not remove that mechanic entirely. I want to give players a reason to build multiple T2 factories, at least on medium and large maps)

~Unit Cannon (T2 Launcher Factory)
-Metal cost increased 6800 to 7200
-HP increased 18000 to 40000
-Added Drifters, Infernos
  (Dev Idea: -Increased HP to be more in line with advanced factory HP for such a significant metal investment.  Allows it to survive 1 nuke in orbital games)
  (Dev Note: -Testing filling out a roster for unit cannon, will look at the addition of storms and especially infernos closely)

~Anti-nuke launcher
-Decreased building cost from 12000 to 5000
-Increased anti-missile cost from 5000 to 9000
-Increased Build rate from 60 to 92
-Increased Energy Drain from 4000 to 6120 (roughly the same 66.7 energy per metal)
(Dev Comment: Helps decrease reaction time/cost for the first missile from 17000 to 14000 but increases fully 3 equipped from 27000 to 32000. Also buildrate is increased to keep non-boosted silo build-times the same at around 80 seconds per shot)

~Nuke Launcher
-Structure cost reduced 14400 to 9600
-Missile cost increased 30000 to 34000
-Metal Build Rate increased 90 to 120
-Energy draw increased 6000 to 7500
(Slightly reduces first shot by 400, but increases cost of follow up by 3000 as the second shot tends to nearly always finish an opponent before they can recover if the first lands.  Also spiced up build rate to devalue boosting)
