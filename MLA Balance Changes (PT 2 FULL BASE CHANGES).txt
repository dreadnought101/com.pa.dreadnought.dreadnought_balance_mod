FULL MLA BASE CHANGES STRUCTURES


~Jig (Orbital Gas Giant Extractor)
-Removed 3,750 energy production (to 0)
-Jig Explosion mainly affects buildings (units take 4 damage, structures take 4000)
  (Dev Idea: Refocuse orbital energy production to Solar Arrays, Jigs cover to many roles and are strong for their value)

~Energy Storage
-HP Reduced from 7500 to 5000
-Metal Cost reduced 450 to 250
-Storage increased 300,000 to 250,000
  (Dev Idea: Decrease cost so its easier to build earlier on)

Advanced Metal Extractor (T2 Economy)
-Health increased 3000 to 5000
-Metal production decreased 18 to 17
(Dev Note: I think production is slightly too strong, but at 1800 metal cost, it should have some strong health for its heavy investment

~Galata (T1 AA structure)
-Increased AA Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

~Single Laser Defense Tower (1 barrel)
-Metal Cost decreased 225 to 165
-Health Decreased 400 to 350
-Range decreased 100 to 90
-Damage decreased 60 to 35
-Vision radius (+underwater vision) reduced from 130 to 110
  (Dev Idea: Adds more support against dox/strykers early game but is vulnerable to stronger T1 units, now 2 shots dox like it 2 shots strykers)

~Lob (T1 Defense Structure)
-Fire rate increased 3 to 4.5
-Metal Cost per shot increased 50 to 60
-Ammo capacity increased 445 to 500
-Ammo demand increased 13 to 15
-Uses Squals (Drone) instead of Dox
  (Dev Idea: Turns the lob into a proper defensive structure instead of a makeshift factory.  Will likely change squal's effectivness or cost soon.
Update:  Uses old numbers before april balance patch)

~Advanced Laser Defense Tower (T2 Defense Structure - triple barrel)
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 875
-Range increased 130 to 140
-Health increased 4000 to 4250
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Flak Cannon (T2)
-HP reduced 2000 to 1700
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 750
-Range increased 120 to 150
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Advanced Torpedo Launcher (T2)
-metal cost reduced 1000 to 950
-range increased 210 to 300
-Rate of fire decreased 2.5 to 2.0/s
-torpedo lifetime increased 5 to 7
-Vision radius increased from 210 to 260
-Underwater vision radius increased 200 to 260
-Radar radius increased 210 to 310
-Sonar radius increased 210 to 310
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Advanced Radar (T2)
-Added 50 radius jamming
(Dev Comment: Allows T2 radar to have a unique impact compared to spamming T1 Radar or having orbital radar. Also increases decision making in placement and can give consideration to building more than 1-2 of these in a game)

~T2 factories. (Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval)
(Dev Note: I'm looking to have factories work better on their own without having to rely heavily on boosting, but not remove that mechanic entirely. I want to give players a reason to build multiple T2 factories, at least on medium and large maps)

-All Advanced Factory costs reduced from 4800 to 4400

Adv Bot Factory
-Metal Build Rate increased 45 to 60
Energy draw per second 1500 to 1800
30 energy per metal
Roll off timer increased 3 seconds to 5

Adv Vehicle Factory
Metal build rate (60) unchanged
Energy 2025 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 4 to 6.5

Adv Air Factory
Metal 45 to 60
Energy 1500 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 2 to 5

Adv Naval Factory
Metal 60 to 72
Energy 1750 to 2015
28 E/M
Roll off time - 6 to 9

~Orbital Launcher (T1)
-Cost increased 600 to 1000

~Orbital Factory
-Cost reduced 6000 to 4000
  (Dev Note: The reduction is quite high, but still accounts for 1000 launcher, and 1300 orbital fab, and the units themselves are mostly cost-prohibitive to get early. I'm hesitant to reduce it all the way to 3600 though)

~Unit Cannon (T2 Launcher Factory)
-Metal cost increased 6800 to 7200
-HP increased 18000 to 40000
-Drifters, Infernos
  (Dev Idea: -Increased HP to be more in line with advanced factory HP for such a significant metal investment.  Allows it to survive 1 nuke in orbital games)
  (Dev Note: -Testing filling out a roster for unit cannon, will look at the addition of storms and especially infernos closely)
