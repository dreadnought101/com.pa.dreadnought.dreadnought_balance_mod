FULL MLA BASE CHANGES STRUCTURES/FABS

~Astraeus (Orbital Transport)
-Orbital arrival delay decreased 3.0 to 2.0
-gravwell 10.0 to 12.0
-System_multi 30.0 to 36.0
-Pickup range increased 20 to 60
-Transport capacity increased 1 to 6
(Multi-unit transportation testing.  Will not touch unit weights for now.  Will try to sort out clunkiness)

~Avenger (Orbital Fighter)
-100 weapon range to 135 (36%)
-weapon projectile speed increased 300 to 400
-Speed/Accel 65 to 90 (brake 20 to 25)
-Orbital arrival delay decreased 3.0 to 2.0
-gravwell 10.0 to 12.0
-System_multi 30.0 to 36.0
(gets 3 shot by other avengers, 1 shot by everything else anti-orbital, next minimum is Omega at 65x2=130 [my version 45x2=90] and anchors at 200, Umbrella is 100)

~Hermes (Orbital Probe)
-Speed 75 to 100 (brake/accel 75 to 100)
-Orbital arrival delay decreased 3.0 to 2.0
-gravwell 10.0 to 12.0
-System_multi 30.0 to 36.0

~ARKYD (basic orbital radar)
-Speed/break/accel 15 to 20
-Decreased health 1000 to 800
(Speed changes and general power requires a tone down in health)

~Artemis (advanced orbital railgun)
-Speed 30 to 50 (brake/accel 10 to 20)
-350 range to 450

~SXX (orbital anti-ground laser)
-Speed 25 to 45 (break/accel 25 to 45)

~Advanced Radar Satellite
-Increased health 5000 to 5600
(No speed changes, coupled with increased orbital delay means it needs to survive longer on well defended planets)

~Omega (Advanced Orbital Battleship)
[TLDR: Its laser guns can hit ground and general quality of life buffs]
-Metal cost reduced 14000 to 12500
-Speed increased 15 to 25 (brake 80 to 120, acceleration 30 to 45)
>Orbital Guns (4 turrets, 2 barrels each)
-added ammo file (it currently uses the same file associated with the Anchor)
-Decreased Laser-Weapons 65x2 to 25x2
-Decreased Laser Turret Pitch Range from 120 to 92.5
-Omega will now prioritize other orbital units first.
-Laser Firerate increased 2.0 to 2.5 (fires 2.5 times a second)
-Main anti-ground beam-gun can now target seafloor units.
(Dev Idea: Reduces cost slightly due to increased orbital factory cost. Adds quality of life changes. Only 2 laser targets can attack a surface target at once unless directly underneath, but all 4 lasers can target in any orbital direction)

~Orbital Navigation
(Increases arrival spread to a planet)
-"orbital_arrival_radius": 100, to 300
-"orbital_arrival_unit_radius": 7.5, to 22.5-"planetary_arrival_cooldown_time": has been increased from 3.0 to 4.0 for most units, and 2.0 for Avenger/Hermes/Astraeus
-Most units have been hemogenized to have identical movement between planets with some exceptions.
>Hermes and Nuke remains extremely fast
>Avenger/Astraeus have been increased to be faster than normal
>Solar array has been increased to average speed
>Unit Cannon has been slowed to average speed
>Orbital Fab/ARKYD/Artemis/SXX/Omega/Advanced Radar/Helios/T2 Air fighter remain unchanged

~Barnacle (T1 Naval)
-build range increased 65 to 95
  (Dev Idea:  allows it to repair more safely and consistently)

~Stitch (Combat Fab)
-Increased health from 50 to 65
  (Dev Idea: Lets them take 2 stray shots from grenadier and slightly bulks up the unit but is still fragile to most things directly)

~Bot Basic Fabricator
-Vision increased 100 to 120
(Vision increase helps with reaction speeds against raiding forces early on)

~Vehicle Basic Fabricator
-Speed increased 12 to 13
-Vision increased 100 to 120
-Increased build range 45 to 50
  (Dev Note: Gives vehicle 1st openers slightly better viability. Bot speed is still 16, and metal cost 150 vs 200 for distinct differences. May increase energy drain or reduce health of vehicle fabs slightly.)

Basic Air Fabricator
-Health increased 25 to 80
-Vision increased 100 to 120
(Can take 2 fighter shots, hopefully this gives air openers a slightly better use case without taking over completely)

~Naval Basic Fabricator
-Health increased 100 to 200
-Move speed increased 10 to 12
-Vision increased 100 to 120
-Increased build range 45 to 50
  (Dev Note: The naval fab has less health than the vehicle fab at 200, despite costing more, having less speed, and more threatening enemy units, not to mention T2 naval fab has more health than T2 vehicle)
  (Dev Note2: Allows for faster openings to cut down on the slow nature of early naval, as well as be less punishing when killing fabs that are far away from a factory spawn point

~Naval Advanced Fabricator
-Build range increased 45 to 55
-Changed deepwater to water-hover
  (Dev Note: This is mostly intended to be a quality of life change to help the adv ship build structures on land, as it does not have water-hover and can't get as close to shore as its basic naval fabricator counterpart)

~Advanced Fabricators [Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval] 
~Bot - Metal 1800 to 1700
     - Build range 45 to 50

~Veh - Metal 2025 to 1900
     - Build range 45 to 55

~Air - Metal 2200 to 2075

~Nav - Metal 2400 to 2225
     - Build range 45 to 55

~Each can now build all types of Titans [Atlas/Ares/Zues]
(Dev Idea: Quality of life change, most players just relied on orbital fabs to build the desired titan)
  (Dev Note: Metal cost reduced rougly 10% across the board, more favoring naval, slightly less favoring bot)

~Solar Array (Advanced Orbital energy producer)
-HP Increase 1000 to 7000
-Metal cost increased 1600 to 5000
-Energy production increased 3200/s to 11000/s
-Added 100,000 energy storage (from 0)
  (Dev Idea: Solar-power is GREEN! and best!  Basically this is the T3 energy producer, much like the Jig)

~Jig (Orbital Gas Giant Extractor)
-HP increased 3000 to 6000
-Metal Cost decreased 4000 to 3750
-Removed 3,750 energy production (to 0)
-Added 10,000 metal storage
-Jig Explosion mainly affects buildings (units take 4 damage, structures take 4000)
  (Dev Idea: Refocuse orbital energy production to Solar Arrays, Jigs cover to many roles and were too strong for its value)

~Energy Storage
-HP Reduced from 7500 to 5000
-Metal Cost reduced 450 to 250
-Storage increased 300,000 to 250,000
  (Dev Idea: Decrease cost so its easier to build earlier on)

~Basic Metal Extractor
-Vision decreased 75 to 80
(Vision used to be 100 in base game, and I just haven't bothered to change it to the new 75 variant.  I do think 80 is actually the sweet spot)

Advanced Metal Extractor (T2 Economy)
-Health increased 3000 to 5000
-Metal production decreased 18 to 17
-Vision decreased 100 to 80
  (Dev Note: I think production is slightly too strong, but at 1800 metal cost, it should have some strong health for its heavy investment)

~Galata (T1 AA structure)
-Increased AA Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

~Single Laser Defense Tower (1 barrel)
-Metal Cost decreased 225 to 165
-Health Decreased 400 to 325
-Range decreased 100 to 90
-Damage decreased 60 to 25
-Turret rotation increased 90 to 120 (Yaw rate)
-Vision radius (+underwater vision) reduced from 130 to 110
  (Dev Idea: Adds more support against dox/strykers early game but is vulnerable to stronger T1 units, now 2 shots dox like it 2 shots strykers)

~Lob (T1 Defense Structure)
[turned Lob into a unit-cannon like structure with limited range, builds Vehicle fabs/Spinners/Strykers, and bot Fabbers/Boombots/Sparks/Stingers/Dox/Grenadiers]
-range increased 240 to 360 
-Ammo capacity 15

~Umbrella (Anti-Orbital Gun)
-Bullet Velocity increased 1000 to 1250
-Lifetime 3 to 2.4

~Anchor (Orbital Defense)
-150 orbital range increased 150 to 200 (ground variant unchanged)

~Catapult (Advanced Missile Defense)
-Metal 2000 to 1750
-Health 1500 to 1000
-Missile velocity increased 80 to 100
-Missile lifetime reduced 15 to 8
-Firerate 0.4 to 0.2857 (Fires once every 3.5 seconds instead of 2.5)
  (Helps discourage constant catapult spam, but also allows for more strategic positions to be built with a metal cost reduction, and perhaps a vehicle push counter strategy)

~Advanced Laser Defense Tower (T2 Defense Structure - triple barrel)
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 875
-Health increased 4000 to 3500
-Range increased 120 to 135
-Damage decreased 250 to 200
-Fire-rate decreased 5.0 to 3.5
  (Dev Idea: I feel this turret obsoletes other turrets with its fire-rate, and would prefer it hurt higher health targets, while mass attacks favors a comprehensive turret line)

~Flak Cannon (T2 AA)
-HP reduced 2000 to 1700
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 750
-Range increased 120 to 150
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Advanced Torpedo Launcher (T2)
-metal cost reduced 1000 to 950
-range increased 210 to 300
-Rate of fire decreased 2.0 to 1.5/s
-torpedo lifetime increased 5 to 7
-Vision radius increased from 210 to 260
-Underwater vision radius increased 200 to 260
-Radar radius increased 210 to 310
-Sonar radius increased 210 to 310
  (Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)

~Advanced Radar (T2)
-Added 100 radius jamming
  (Dev Comment: Allows T2 radar to have a unique impact compared to spamming T1 Radar or having orbital radar. Also increases decision making in placement and can give consideration to building more than 1-2 of these in a game)

~Orbital Launcher (T1)
-Cost increased 600 to 1000

(Dev Note: Reduce Boosting)

~Orbital Factory
-Cost reduced 6000 to 4000
-Metal Buildrate increased 60 to 72
-Energy demand increased 2000 to 2400
-Factory cooldown increased 4 to 6
  (Dev Note: The reduction is quite high, but still accounts for 1000 launcher, and 1300 orbital fab, and the units themselves are mostly cost-prohibitive to get early. I'm hesitant to reduce it all the way to 3600 though
Dev Note 2: Reduce Boosting)

~T2 factories. (Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval)
-All Advanced Factory costs reduced from 4800 to 4400

Adv Bot Factory
-Metal Build Rate increased 45 to 60
Energy draw per second 1500 to 1800
30 energy per metal
Roll off timer increased 3 seconds to 5

Adv Vehicle Factory
Metal build rate (60) unchanged
Energy 2025 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 4 to 6.5

Adv Air Factory
Metal 45 to 60
Energy 1500 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 2 to 5

Adv Naval Factory
Metal 60 to 72
Energy 1750 to 2015
28 E/M
Roll off time - 6 to 9

  (Dev Note: I'm looking to have factories work better on their own without having to rely heavily on boosting, but not remove that mechanic entirely. I want to give players a reason to build multiple T2 factories, at least on medium and large maps)

~Unit Cannon (T2 Launcher Factory)
-Metal cost 5600 to 6000 
-HP 18000 to 32000
-Added Drifters, Skitters to build list
-Increased Pod Capacity 16 to 20
-Pod Speed decreased 250 to 200
-Stingray/Umbrella/Catapult anti-pod missiles speed increased 200 to 400 [Bluehawk anti-pod component removed entirely]
   (Dev Idea: -Increased HP to be more in line with advanced factory HP for such a significant metal investment.  Allows it to survive 1 nuke in orbital games.  Other general buffs, helps T1 units)

~Anti-nuke launcher
-Decreased building cost from 12000 to 5000
-Increased anti-missile cost from 5000 to 9000
-Increased Build rate from 60 to 92
-Increased Energy Drain from 4000 to 6120 (roughly the same 66.7 energy per metal)
  (Dev Idea: Helps decrease reaction time/cost for the first missile from 17000 to 14000 but increases fully 3 equipped from 27000 to 32000. Also buildrate is increased to keep non-boosted silo build-times the same at around 80 seconds per shot)

~Nuke Launcher
-Structure cost reduced 14400 to 9600
-Missile cost increased 30000 to 34000
-Metal Build Rate increased 90 to 120
-Energy draw increased 6000 to 7500
  (Dev Note: Slightly reduces first shot by 400, but increases cost of follow up by 3000 as the second shot tends to nearly always finish an opponent before they can recover if the first lands.  Also spiced up build rate to devalue boosting)
