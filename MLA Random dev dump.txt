Increase speed of dox slightly?
Reduce leveler damage a bit
Reduce Anti-Missile building cost, increase individual missile 
Sheller changes, slower projectile, lower AOE radius, more accurate

Leveler 
300 to 250 damage (2x250)
Partial Radius 3 to 2 (Full 1 unchanged)

Icarus
Ground 20 damage (unchanged fire-rate 1/s)
Range unchanged
Air 30 damage (fire-rate every 3/s)
Range 70 to 150
300 to 600 energy per shot


Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)

Icarus changes
Add different weapon type (same ammo drain) for air
Increase air weapon version to much further range
maybe decrease ground range from 80 to 70
Ground damage 20
Air damage 30
-Additional ideas, remove ammo from air component or increase drain
Would be a dream if ground had a projectile or reduce speed
-Also a charge up mechanic...?



~Add PPBAOE to bombers+wyrms


~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else
-Try mini unit cannon?

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit
MLA fabricators and factories will build Legion stuff if the mod is enabled

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Lob revamp
-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Icarus revamp to have seperate air and ground weapons,
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes
-Hummingbird nerfs, Pheonix cleave changes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Fire
