--Dev done

Commander
-Death nuke Damage increased from 2000 to 3000
-Death nuke Splash Radius increased from 110 to 130
-Death nuke Burn Radius increased from 137 to 157 (only affects trees)

Slammer
-Sub type added (Will no longer be ignored by torpedo weapon priorities when submerged)

Naval Fab
-Health increased 125 to 150 [Vanilla 100]

Typhoon
-Build Metal Cost updated from 90 to 30 (Does not affect the Typhoon's build rate but reflects the actual cost of squalls in UI)

Teleporter
-Health decreased from 9750 to 9000    
-Metal Cost increased from 800 to 1000

T2 Metal Extractor
-Increased Selection Radius from 28 to 36
(Quality of Life test: Purpose is to help select a T2 extractor when both a T1 extractor [currently at 24 selection diameter] and it are on the same metal node)

--Todo









Work on omega

Make ARKYD and Solar Array structures


SXX comm damage reduce, other increases

SXX hitting underwater





WIP Manhatten explosion (got small fallout in already)
-Radius reduced 150 to 80 (Animation also reduced by around 50%)


Legion Combat fabs auto reclaim
Legion support commander build range 45

Legion Naval fab, weights+Transports, Launcher rolloff
Legion Radar (Sputnik) and Adv Radar (Cosmos)

Increase Nuke cruise height








Lob doing SXX sounds?


--LONG TERM Todo


-Spark projectile always explodes
-Transport adjustments


Single/double turret vision reductions? (Would be interesting if double turret range was bigger than vision, and single turret had 130 vision) (or maybe not, shit idea)



Add aim turrets to Drifter + Leveler and Sheller?

Typhoon changes to torpedos


Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


--
Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Orbital Movement Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.
Lob projectiles can go all over the place when fired at close range

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
