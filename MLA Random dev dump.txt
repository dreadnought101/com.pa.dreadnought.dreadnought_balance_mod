--Dev done

Orbital Factory
-Metal Buildrate increased 60 to 72
-Energy demand increased 2000 to 2400
-Factory cooldown increased 4 to 6
(Dev Note: Reduce Boosting)

ARKYD 
-Decreased health 1000 to 800
(Speed changes and general power requires a tone down)

Advanced Radar Satellite
-Increased health 5000 to 5600
(No speed changes, coupled with increased orbital delay means it needs to survive longer on well defended planets)

Atlas
-Removed damage nerfs coupled with health buffs and return Atlas to its original state

Basic Air Fabricator
-Health increased 25 to 80
(Can take 2 fighter shots, hopefully this gives air openers a slightly better use case without taking over)

Basic Metal Extractor
-Vision decreased 100 to 80
(Helps with raiding/snipes and extractors covering too much area to sneak things in)

--Todo

Add Nuke Explode death Vision

Mex Vision 100 to 80

Air Fab 25 to 100 (watch custom tag)

Single/double turret vision reductions? (Woud be interesting if double turret range was bigger than vision, and single turret had 130 vision) (or maybe not, shit idea)



Add aim turrets to Drifter + Leveler and Sheller?

Typhoon changes to torpedos

Increase speed of dox slightly?

Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else
-Try mini T1 unit cannon?

--
Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Orbital Movement Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
-Legion Combatible
