Air fabricator 
-Vision 120 to 100 [Vanilla 100]

Orbital Factory
-metal cost 4000 to 3800 [Vanilla 4200]

Advanced Radar Satellite
-Vision Radius 600 to 500
-Radar Radius 1000 to 800

Bluehawk
-Anti-ground and Anti-Orbital weapons split into 2 different parts
-Anti-ground missile unchanged
-Anti-orbital missile velocity increased 100 to 200 [Vanilla 80]
-Anti-orbital missile lifetime increased 8 to 6 [Vanilla 15]
-Added targetting priorities for specific orbital anti-ground units and transport units, then combat units, then non-combat orbital units 

Catapult
-Anti-ground and Anti-Orbital weapons split into 2 different parts
-Anti-ground missile unchanged
-Anti-orbital missile velocity increased 100 to 200 [Vanilla 80]
-Anti-orbital missile lifetime increased 8 to 6 [Vanilla 15]
-Fire-rate of 0.2857 maintained [Vanilla 0.4]
-Added targetting priorities for specific orbital anti-ground units and transport units, then combat units, then non-combat orbital units 

Stingray
-Anti-ground and Anti-Orbital weapons split into 2 different parts
-Anti-ground missile unchanged
-Anti-orbital missile velocity increased 100 to 200 [Vanilla 80]
-Anti-orbital missile lifetime increased 8 to 7 [Vanilla 60]
-Added targetting priorities for specific orbital anti-ground units and transport units, then combat units, then non-combat orbital units 

SXX Laser Platform
-Can now attack underwater and seafloor targets
-Damage against commanders specifically reduced by 50%
(Allows more usefulness on water planets, but also reduces their main power in killing commanders, very hesitant in general to do specific damage reductions like so but commanders are an exception.  Will probably be reworking SXX to be more resilient against anti-orbital guns but less damaging overall)

Naval Basic Fabricator
-Health decreased 200 to 125 [Vanilla 100]
-Speed increased 12 to 13 [Vanilla 10]
-Build rate decreased 14 to 13 m/s 
-Energy rate decreased 800 to 750 (57.1 energy per metal to 57.7)
(Dev note: The naval fab was a bit too powerful overall but still suffered from snipes being too punishing when out on the map)

Pirhanna 
-range decreased 110 to 109 [Vanilla 105]
(Resolves a very specific bug with double laser turrets sometimes not firing at pirhannas.  I normally prefer divisions of 5 but this will be an exception) 

Barracuda
-Speed increased 14 to 15
(General naval speed buffs)

Narwhal
-Speed increased 12 to 13
(General naval speed buffs)

Pelican
-Weight capacity reduced 6 to 5 [Vanilla 1 - Beta 10]

Astraeus
-Transport capacity reduced 10 to 6 [Vanilla 6 - Beta 18]

Transport Weights
-T2 Naval Fab can now be transported at a weight of 5
-Pirhanna weight reduced 5 to 2
-Inferno weight reduced 8 to 5
-T1 Naval Fab weight reduced 5 to 3
-Spark reduced 5 to 3
-T1 Bot/Vehicle/Air Fab/Locust/Drifter/Spinner/Stinger reduced 4 to 3
-T2 Bot Fab/T2 Combat Fab/T2 Vehicle Fab/Colonel reduced 8 to 5
(Simplified and readded some T2 units to pelican transport.  Will add naval units that can be transported by Astraeus soon.  Updated all unit info cards [English] with the weight size for units) 

[Final list]
Weight for
1 - Dox/Stryker/Skitter
2 - Grenadier/Ant/Boombot/Pirhanna
3 - Spark/Drifter/Spinner/Stinger/Slammer/Gille/Bluehawk/Locust/T1 Bot+Vehicle+Naval+Air Fab
5 - Inferno/Leveler/Sheller/Storm/T2 Bot+Vehicle+Naval Fab/T1+T2 Combat Fab/Colonel/Barnacle
6 - Vangaurd/T2 Air Fab
(Will keep an eye on boombots, but for now, 2 per pelican transport)


--Todo




Work on omega

Make ARKYD and Solar Array structures


SXX comm damage reduce, other increases

SXX hitting underwater





WIP Manhatten explosion (got small fallout in already)
-Radius reduced 150 to 80 (Animation also reduced by around 50%)


Legion Combat fabs auto reclaim
Legion support commander build range 45

Legion Naval fab, weights+Transports, Launcher rolloff
Legion Radar (Sputnik) and Adv Radar (Cosmos)

Increase Nuke cruise height








Lob doing SXX sounds?


--LONG TERM Todo


-Spark projectile always explodes
-Transport adjustments


Single/double turret vision reductions? (Would be interesting if double turret range was bigger than vision, and single turret had 130 vision) (or maybe not, shit idea)



Add aim turrets to Drifter + Leveler and Sheller?

Typhoon changes to torpedos


Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


--
Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Orbital Movement Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.
Lob projectiles can go all over the place when fired at close range

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
