--Dev done


Fixed Orca/Vangaurd effects

from WL_LandHorizontal to WL_AnySurface
Ant, Inferno, Vanguard, Drifter, Leveler, Boom ,Locust

--Todo

Locust health from 60 to 75
Reduce cost from 265 to 255 [Vanilla 260]
(Dev Note: Locust became weaker due to factory changes, this is to adjust)

"Galata remove AT_Orbital damage modifier

Manhattan
speed 7 -> 10
turn rate 45 -> 60
turn acceleration 15 -> 30


Legion Support
Added Commander and adv factories
will need to do fabs/orbital stuff I think
Don't need to add reg factories hopefully

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)

Icarus changes
Add different weapon type (same ammo drain) for air
Increase air weapon version to much further range
maybe decrease ground range from 80 to 70
Ground damage 20
Air damage 30
-Additional ideas, remove ammo from air component or increase drain
Would be a dream if ground had a projectile or reduce speed
-Also a charge up mechanic...?

~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else




UNDER THE HOOD DEV STUFF

from WL_LandHorizontal to WL_AnySurface
Ant, Inferno, Vanguard, Drifter, Leveler, Boom ,Locust, manhattan ,Leviathan, Piranha 

Ignoring Manhattan, Levi, Pirhanna

~Skitter
(Command Caps)
add "ORDER_Attack"  (Removed this)




KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit
MLA fabricators and factories will build Legion stuff if the mod is enabled

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Lob revamp
-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Icarus revamp to have seperate air and ground weapons,
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes
-Hummingbird nerfs, Pheonix cleave changes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Fire
