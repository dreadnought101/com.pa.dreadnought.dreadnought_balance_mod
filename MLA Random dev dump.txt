--Dev done

Unit Cannon
-Adjusted Pod Capacity from 1 to 100 (fixes bug with scaling up size of units for the transport system, does not affect actual gameplay)

Pelican (Air transport)
-Weight Capacity 1 to 8
-HP 100 to 225 [Vanilla 150] 
-Metal Cost 155 to 240 [Vanilla 140]
-Movespeed reduced 75 to 70 [Vanilla 70]
-Added load range 15 
-Added chase range 5
-Usable range 30 to 4084 (Matches Vanilla bug fix)
(Can now essentially transport naval t1 fabs/Pirhannas/Barnacles and more of T1/T2 ground units, see weights for more details)

Astraeus (Orbital Transport)
-Weight Capacity 1 to 10
-Added load range 50
-Added chase range 20
-pickup range 60 to 4048 (Matches Vanilla bug fix)
(Can now essentially transport naval Pirhannas/Barnacles/orcas/narwhals alongside pirhannas as well as T2 air fabs+Kestrels as well as carry more T1/T2 ground units, see weights for more details)

Orbital Launcher
-Rolloff timer decreased 3 to 2 seconds
(Allows more spam of avengers, especially when offsetting its increased cost and building size)

T1 Naval Fab
-Turn rate increased 90 to 120
(Makes them a tad more manueverable and survivable)

Single Laser Defense Tower (T1 Turret)
-Turret Rotation increased 120 to 135 [Vanilla 90]

Stryker
-Reduced Speed 21 to 20 [Vanilla 17]

Dox
-Reduced Speed 21 to 20 [Vanilla 20]

Piranha
-Metal Cost increased 160 to 165 [Vanilla 150]

Typhoon
-Squal drone laser air/ground weapon damage reduced 50 to 40
  >Splash radius 0.75 and 20 damage component removed


--Todo

Weight for
1 - Dox/Stryker/Skitter
2 - *Grenadier/Ant/Boombot
3 - *Slammer/Gille/Bluehawk
4 - *T1 Bot/Vehicle/Air Fab/Locust/Drifter/Spinner/Stinger
5 - *T1 Naval/Barnacle/Spark/Combat Fab/Leveler/Sheller/Storm/Pirhana
8 - *Inferno/T2 Bot Fab/T2 Combat Fab/T2 Vehicle Fab/Vangaurd
10 - Orca/Narwhwal/Colonel/Kestrel/T2 Naval Fab*/T2 Air Fab*
20 - Kaiju
40 - Leviathan, Typhoon, Stingray
(General ideas are that it doesn't change units much that are already strong like inferno+spark+vangaurd, but increases others that are weaker though fabs and AA are a higher weight class due to potential.  Will keep an eye on boombots as well) 

(Boombot, Sheller, added only for weights for now)


Nerf T2 orbital radar vision 600 to 500
radar 1200 to 1000

Seperate Catapult/Stingray/Bluehawk missiles


Work on omega

Make ARKYD and Solar Array structures


SXX comm damage reduce, other increases

SXX hitting underwater





WIP Manhatten explosion (got small fallout in already)
-Radius reduced 150 to 80 (Animation also reduced by around 50%)


Legion Combat fabs auto reclaim
Legion support commander build range 45

Legion Naval fab, weights+Transports, Launcher rolloff
Legion Radar (Sputnik) and Adv Radar (Cosmos)

Increase Nuke cruise height








Lob doing SXX sounds?


--LONG TERM Todo


-Spark projectile always explodes
-Transport adjustments


Single/double turret vision reductions? (Woud be interesting if double turret range was bigger than vision, and single turret had 130 vision) (or maybe not, shit idea)



Add aim turrets to Drifter + Leveler and Sheller?

Typhoon changes to torpedos


Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


--
Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Orbital Movement Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.
Lob projectiles can go all over the place when fired at close range

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
