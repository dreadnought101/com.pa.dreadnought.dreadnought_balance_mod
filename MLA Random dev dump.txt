--Todo

(Comm done, Air+Orbital+Naval done, land done, but update ALL CHANGE notes!)

SXX comm damage reduce, other increases

SXX hitting underwater




WIP Manhatten explosion (got small fallout in already)
-Radius reduced 150 to 80 (Animation also reduced by around 50%)


Legion Combat fabs auto reclaim
Legion support commander build range 45

Increase Nuke cruise height



Skitter dummy wep
Stinger/Spinnder/Storm dummy wep







Nuke icon (sound?) not showing up bug
Lob doing SXX sounds?


--LONG TERM Todo


-Spark projectile always explodes
-Transport adjustments


Single/double turret vision reductions? (Woud be interesting if double turret range was bigger than vision, and single turret had 130 vision) (or maybe not, shit idea)



Add aim turrets to Drifter + Leveler and Sheller?

Typhoon changes to torpedos


Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


--
Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Orbital Movement Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.
Lob projectiles can go all over the place when fired at close range

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
-Legion Combatible
