Fix PBAOE

Icarus AA damage 30 to 25
range decreased 150 to 90

Skitter scout speed increased 32 to 35

Increase spinner fire-rate to 2.4 

Icarus air damage 30 to 25, cost increase by 5, speed decrease by 5. air range decrease?

Drifter 125 damage, but 2.5 firerate to 3.0
or 3.2 and 160 damage
5 metal increase again

Increase T2 fab cost slightly, but not to original

Reduce firerate of T3 turret slightly, and range?

Typhoon changes to torpedos

Increase speed of naval fab/s and add water-hover to T2 fab

Readd priority to Stingray

Decrease missile launcher cost, increase missile cost


Increase speed of dox slightly?
Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering)
Nerf T2 fighter?

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


~Add PPBAOE to bombers+wyrms


~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else
-Try mini T1 unit cannon?

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit
MLA fabricators and factories will build Legion stuff if the mod is enabled

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
