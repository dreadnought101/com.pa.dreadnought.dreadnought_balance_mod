Orbital



T3 Turret 130 to 135

Typhoon changes to torpedos

Increase speed of naval fab/s and add water-hover to T2 fab

Narwhal torp changes
decrease range, Lifetime, firerate adjustment, damage 100 to 150


Increase speed of dox slightly?
Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else
-Try mini T1 unit cannon?

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
-Legion Combatible
