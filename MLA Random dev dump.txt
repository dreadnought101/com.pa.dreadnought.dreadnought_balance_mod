--Dev done

Commander
-Increase Commander AA AOE from 0.75 to 1.5
-No longer auto targets icarus
-[Added general PEWPEWPEW effects]

Lob (Transformed into a Unit Cannon)
-Range 240 to 480 (no orbital.  Will likely be 360 after buffed testing)
-Metal Cost 1200 to 900 (Will likely be 1200 after buffed testing)
-Vision 100 
-Health 1000 
-Metal Draw 13 to 20 (Will likely be 18 after buffed testing)
-Energy Draw 0 to 900 
-Unit Capacity 13 to 20 
-2.0 Factory roll off timer added
-Buildable Units > Skitter, Stryker, Dox, Boombot, vehicle fab, bot fab, grenadier, spinner, stinger, stitch (No Spark, Ant, Drifters, Infernos)
(I want an OP state to see what makes players hurt, and tone back to given numbers above afterwards. In terms of Unit Capacity, I will likely be buffing Starcannon and maybe the Unit Cannon to similar Lob numbers)

Drifter
-Increased idle aim delay from 3 to 5

Leveler
-Increased idle aim delay from 3 to 5

Orca
-Increases turn_accel from 15 to 60
(Some tests to improve Naval navigation)

--Todo




-Nuke explosion leaves vision for 2 seconds, showcasing what it destroys
-Spark projectile always explodes
-Transport adjustments
-Leveler+Drifter turret holds (sheller?)  Either idle aim delay or dummy weapon

Add Nuke Explode death Vision


Single/double turret vision reductions? (Woud be interesting if double turret range was bigger than vision, and single turret had 130 vision) (or maybe not, shit idea)



Add aim turrets to Drifter + Leveler and Sheller?

Typhoon changes to torpedos

Increase speed of dox slightly?

Sheller changes, lower AOE radius, more accurate (Still considering) Its actually perfectly accurate

Spark - added a 'die_here' command which will have projectile explode after lifetime completeion  (Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something, which at current range is a few units past the target)


~Lob
(Dev Idea: The lob's current role is a 1-dimensional factory, not a defensive structure, this will change its role to units that have a limited life-span but have more impact)
-Atm have lobs firing typhoon drone, but considering something else
-Try mini T1 unit cannon?

--
Perhaps increase orbital fab health 100 to something higher due to anti-orbital changes and slower arival cooldown.

Increase Omega range? Has direct impact on ground however

Perhaps Hemogenize Hermes/Avenger/Astraeus to 8.0 gravwell and 19.0 System Multi for simplicity, instead of the upscaling 7.0/8.0/9.0 and 16.75/18.75/22.0 which has compelling tactical dynamics, but may be superfluous to most except high levels for those in the know.

Orbital Movement Perhaps tone down Nuke speed, perhaps keep unit cannon high speed.

KNOWN ISSUES

Grenadier torpedos sometimes firing in a random direction when coming in range of a naval unit.
Lob projectiles can go all over the place when fired at close range

CONSIDERING (some ideas that may or not be implemented)

-Horsefly buffs and nerfs
-Omega AOE component
-Jig explosion only affects buildings, Ares ground pound only affects buildings
-Spark projectile always explodes

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Air Scout
-Legion Combatible
