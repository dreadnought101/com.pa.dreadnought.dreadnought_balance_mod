Patch 1.50  --Orbital Patch [TLDR Increases speed and attack range of many orbital units and hemogenizes movement speed between planets]

Orbital Navigation (Increases arrival spread to a planet)
-"orbital_arrival_radius": 100, to 300
-"orbital_arrival_unit_radius": 7.5, to 22.5-"planetary_arrival_cooldown_time": has been increased from 3.0 to 4.0 for most units, and 2.0 for Avenger/Hermes/Astraeus
-Most units have been hemogenized to have identical movement between planets with some exceptions.
>Hermes and Nuke remains extremely fast
>Avenger/Astraeus have been increased to be faster than normal
>Solar array has been increased to average speed
>Unit Cannon has been slowed to average speed
>Orbital Fab/ARKYD/Artemis/SXX/Omega/Advanced Radar/Helios/T2 Air fighter remain unchanged

Astraeus
-Movespeed/Brake/Accel 25 to 50
-Health reduced 225 to 150 [Vanilla 150]
-System multiplier 10.0 to 16.75
-gravwell multiplier 5.0 to 7.0
-Orbital Arrival delay reduced 3.0 to 2.0
(Orbital Movement has been increased roughly 20% from slower than other orbital units to faster)

Anchor 
-150 orbital range 150 to 200 (25%)

Hermes
-Speed/brake/accel 75 to 100
-Orbital Arrival delay reduced 3.0 to 2.0

Avenger  
-HP increased 50 to 90 
-Speed/Accel 65 to 90 (brake 20 to 25)
-System multiplier 15.0 to 18.75
-gravwell multiplier 6.0 to 8.0
-100 weapon range to 135 (36%)
-weapon projectile speed - 300 to 400
-Orbital Arrival delay reduced 3.0 to 2.0
(gets 3 shot by other avengers, 1 shot by everything else anti-orbital, next minimum is Omega at 65x2=130 [my version 45x2=90] and anchors at 200, Umbrella is 100)

Orbital Fabricator
(Unchanged)

ARKYD basic orbital radar
-Speed/break/accel 15 to 20

Artemis
-Speed 30 to 50 (brake/accel 10 to 20)
-350 range to 450 (23.3%)

SXX
-Speed/break/accel 25 to 45

Omega
-Speed 15 to 25 (brake 80 to 120, acceleration 30 to 45)
-Turret Pitch Range 90 to 92.5 [Vanilla 120]
(Turret change allows for all 4 turrets to hit things directly beneath omega, but only 2-3 turrets will attack things on the edge)

Advanced Radar Sattelite
(Unchanged)

Solar Array
-Gravwell_veloc 3.0 to 6.0

Helios
(Unchanged)

Nuke
(Unchanged)

Unit Cannon
-System Multi 20.0 to 15.0
-Gravwell 10.0 to 6.0

Pheonix T2 Air Fighter
(Unchanged)
