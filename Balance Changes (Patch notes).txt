Patch 1.62

Single Laser Turret
-health decreased 350 to 325
-damage decreased 35 to 25
-turret rotation increased 90 to 120 (Yaw rate)
(Still 2 shots strykers and dox, increased rotation for more effectiveness against those units as well as boombots+locusts, health+damage nerf against ants+sparks)

Locust
-Increase attack range 30 to 35
-Increase vision 40 to 45
-Added radar vision 75
(Adjusted true vision to ensure a player can see the destruction wrought by their locust attacks.  Added radar to allow a player imperfect vision to work with, though combod with other units still is important)

Omega
-Laser turret damage decreased 90 to 50 [Vanilla 130 or 65x2]
-Laser turret firerate increased 1.5 to 2.5 [Vanilla 2.0] 
(Reworked the omega to be more devestating against avengers while its DPS overall is relatively the same)

Avenger
-Health reduced 90 to 50
(The 90 health test made it too snowbally against other players with less avengers in the early game, and the 50 variant serves to help improve omegas)

Transports
-Adjusted all Air/Orbital transports [Pelican/Osprey/Astraeus/Chariot] transporter range from 2000 to 4084 [old vanilla 20, new vanilla 4084] 
(More just under the hood dev stuff)

Legion
-Implemented all Legion changes from Patch 1.29.0 excluding Jeagers (Still cannot travel through teleporters due to the MLA/Bug equivelent Kaijus unable to do so as well)
-Added a fix to MLA mine detecting units to also detect deployed infiltrators [Stitches/Mends/Skitters/Barnacles]
(There is also currently an issue where Legion shields will not block MLA units, but that requires modifying a hundred MLA units' ammo files which boggles my mind, perhaps I'll fix that later)

Viper (T1 Orbital Fighter)
-Decreased secondary (close range) weapon damage 40 to 15
(Combos with Avenger changes, will watch matchup closely on long range+short range engagement outcomes)
