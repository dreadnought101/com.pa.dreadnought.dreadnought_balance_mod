-Patch 1.41

~Commander
(Allows commander walking to be more common and push out on the map. I also want to put wall damage to 150% but WIP.
The torpedo change increases commander kill time for sea based engagements, due to it being significantly higher than land engagements that are around 204 dps including uber cannons, while sea based engagements are at 400 dps)
-Increased move speed from 6 to 8
-increased uber cannon damage against structures from 25% to 72% (Roughly 500 damage a shot. Commander vs commander 0.25 is unchanged)
-decreased commander Torpedo weapon vs commanders from 100% to 50%

~Colonel
(added quality of life changes)
-build arm range 20->30
-turn rate 90->180
-remove "turn_in_place":false

~Galata
-Can now damage orbital units
(Mostly fixes it from being unable to damage a landing astraeus 

~Barnacle
-Decreased build range from 120 to 95 [Vanilla 70]

~Vanguard
(Makes it so Vanguards have a better role on the frontlines of an army, but also makes them less devestating if they are inside an enemy base)
-Increased range 30 to 60
-Decreased damage from 2000 to 750 (Including splash)
-Increased fire rate from 0.5 to 1.0 (Fires 1 shot every 1 second, instead of 1 shot every 2 seconds)

~Slammer
-Torpedo Fire rate increased 0.25 to 0.75 (Fires three times more often)

~Pheonix 
(I want to differentiate the T2 fighter more from its T1 counterpart, as the T2 fighter feels like a direct upgrade upgrade without its own quirks unlike most other T1 to T2 versions)
-Split Pheonix weapon from 2 firing points to 4, and added seperate sockets so each fires individually rather than in succession.
-Firerate decreased from 7.5 to 1.0 x4 (each weapon gets their own firing timer now)
-missile speed increased 150 to 250
-Bullet lifetime 2.0 to 1.5
-range increased 145 to 150 (Vanilla 120)
(Under the hood dev stuff) -"nearby_target_tick_update_interval": 0.2, (Main)
-"firing_standard_deviation": 25, (Weapon)

~Omega
>Orbital Guns (4 turrets, 2 barrels each)
-added ammo file (it currently uses the same file associated with the Anchor)
-Reduced Orbital gun range from 175 to 150 [Vanilla 150] 
-Added anti-ground/air/sea to orbital guns. [Adjusted Turret Pitch_Range from 60 to 90 in order to properly hit ground]  (Does not attack seafloor)
-Omega will prioritize other orbital units first.
-Damage 65x2 to 40x2 perr turret.
-Firerate increased 1.0 to 1.5 (fires 1.5 times a second)
>Anti-Ground Lazer
-Main anti-ground gun can now target seafloor units.
-Added auto attack component

Ant, Inferno, Vanguard, Drifter, Leveler, Boom, and Locust.


Patch 1.42
