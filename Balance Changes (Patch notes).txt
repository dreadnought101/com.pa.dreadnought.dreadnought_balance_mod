-Patch 1.28

-Stingray
(Gives naval units an answer to the long range hornet, as well as more potent damage against wyrms and horseflies)
Added Anti-Air component to cruise missile [No priority]

-Hosefly
(The AA component is mostly for taking out slow, wide-hitbox targets like hornets, wyrms, angels, and other horseflies.  Horseflies also have potency against Zues Titans now)
-Added Anti-Air component to flak cannon [Prioritises Anti-Air ground units first]
-Changed air damage modifier from 0.5 to 1.0 [Horseflies do full damage vs air]

-(Dev stuff, added various unit effects from pewpewpew mostly for my own sanity, but in turn created insanity inducing moments where the mod would crash instantly, has been fixed, but note to others, don't add Ammo Trails)
