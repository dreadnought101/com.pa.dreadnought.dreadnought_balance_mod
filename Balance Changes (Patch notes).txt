Patch 1.53  More Legion Hemogenization and some MLA/Legion tuning, with better air fabs and lower mex vision range

--MLA

Orbital Factory
-Metal Buildrate increased 60 to 72
-Energy demand increased 2000 to 2400
-Factory cooldown increased 4 to 6
(Dev Note: Reduce Boosting)

ARKYD 
-Decreased health 1000 to 800
(Speed changes and general power requires a tone down)

Advanced Radar Satellite
-Increased health 5000 to 5600
(No speed changes, coupled with increased orbital delay means it needs to survive longer on well defended planets)

Atlas
-Removed damage nerfs coupled with health buffs and return Atlas to its original state

Basic Air Fabricator
-Health increased 25 to 80
(Can take 2 fighter shots, hopefully this gives air openers a slightly better use case without taking over)

Basic Metal Extractor
-Vision decreased 100 to 80
(Helps with raiding/snipes and extractors covering too much area to sneak things in)


--LEGION

Thor (Walker Titan)
-Thor health increased 60000 to 95000
-Thor Movespeed increased 11 to 13
-Cannon range reduced 400 to 270
-Cannon damage reduced 2x600 to 2x200 (+splash)
-Cannon firerate increased 3.03 to 2 seconds per shot
-Cannon splash radius reduced 15 to 5
-Laser range reduced 250 to 200
-Laser damage reduced 175 to 100 (+splash 150 to 100)
-Laser splash radius reduced 5 to 0.5
-Laser spread fire set to true
-Missile Range increased 170 to 180
-Missile splash radius reduced 12 to 5
-Missile damage increased 100x16 to 140x16 (+splash 100 to 140)
-Missile Firerate increased from 11.11 to 8.0 seconds per shot
-Crush damage (Stomp) reduced 500 to 400
-Crush damage only damages buildings. 
-Crush damage fire rate increased 0.76 to 0.5 (fires more often
(Dev Note: I want to increase Thor's ability to survive and tank on the frontline as an assault bot, and in turn reduce its damage so a singular thor cant wipe out armies but allows supporting armies to do the damage for it)

Odin (Armor Titan)
-Health 50000 to 45000
-Main gun damage decreased 5600 to 4900
-Main gun AOE reduced 30 to 20 (partial damage 600, full damage radius reduced 10 to 5)
-Odin stomp/crush now deals full structure to buildings, and aprox 0.1% or 2-3 damage to nearby units.
-Increased crush fire-rate from 1 to 2 attacks a second [Same as Ares, and now matches its dps as well]
(Note 1: I enjoy the crush mechanics of the Ares and Odin. I think it should do inconsequential damage to nearby units, but be significant against structures.  
Note 2: I also decreased its health, but tweeked damage as compensation for Ares vs Odin matchups so that the Ares wins when using secondary guns but loses when it does not. Note 3: I decreased main damage radius and partial damage so that targetting high health targets matter more, but increased partial damage radius for now as compensation, however I may nerf it if the Odin performs too well against T2 compositions compared to Ares)


Catfish
-Changed from Deepwater to water-hover
-Torpedo damage reduced 250 to 150
(Allows Legion to function on maps with shallows, as well as handle stoke spam that plagues Legion v Legion games. Torpedo reduction is compensation)

Akula
-Firing arc increased 60 to 360
-Torpedo turn rate reduced 120 to 75 (Lifetime 4.0)
(This helps Akulas be utilized as the model is difficult to view at a glance where it is pointed and if its firing. The turn rate and lifetime makes it difficult to hit things from behind)

Bowhead
-Adjusted turret positions to face directly left/right
-Adjusted yaw range from 120 to 135 [turrets can turn further]

Add Lynx as an anti-air armor
-Health 155
-Metal Cost 170
-Speed 13
-Vision 100
Lynx Weapon fires a salvo of 2 shots near instantly, then 1 shot every 0.5 seconds
-25 damage (Splash radius 1.5)
-Range 110
-Velocity 200
-Ammo capacity 1
-Ammo drain per shot 0.5
-Rate of fire 4.0 (fires 4 shots a second [however ammo recharge makes the Lynx fire twice a second after initial salvo])
-Gave Lynx standard Air Targetting priorities (focuses transports, bombers, gunships first)

Orbital Launcher
-Metal cost increased 600 to 1000

Orbital Factory
-Metal cost reduced 6000 to 4000
-Build rate increased 60 to 72
-Energy demand increased 2000 to 2400
-Factory cooldown increased 4 to 6

Viper
-Reduced health from 180 to 80 [Base 100 health]
-Increase Main weapon Yaw-Range from 75 to 90 (180 degree firing arc) [base 280 range weapon]
-Increase Secondary Weapon yaw_range from 75 to 360 [base 140 range weapon]
-Decreased turn rate from 200 to 100
(The 180 health was a pure hemogenization moment.  This is an actual balance change.  Gets 2 shot by avenger, 1 shot by omegas/imperators. More changes may come to make the matchup more dynamic, but for now this will be a simple reduction to get things in shape)

Patriot (Walker AA)  
-Metal cost 100 to 150
-Health 100 to 120
-Move speed 15 to 14
-Vision Radius 100 to 90
-Increased Model size by 50%
-Damage 25 to 35
-Bullet Lifetime 1.0 to 1.2
-Added 1.5 splash radius
-Rate of fire increased 4 to 5
-Fires 3 shots a salvo.  Takes 3.6 seconds to recharge.  Does not recharge while firing
-Range 100 to 190
-DPS aprox 32

Overseer (T2 Radar)
-Added 100 radius jamming

Scythe
-Firing arc increased 89 to 105
-Health increased 120 to 150 [MLA 120 to 150]
-damage increased 29x2 to 32x2 
(Helps maintain the 3 shot ratio of Scythe against Corsair and added slight QOL in arc radius with regular Legion arc overhaul)

Firebird
-Health decreased 240 to 225 [MLA 240 to 225]

Corsair
-Partial Splash radius reduced 10 to 5
-Full Splash radius reduced 2 to 1

Basic Air Fabricator
-Health decreased 85 to 80
-Speed increased 30 to 35 (+30 brake/accel to 35)
(While I generally still want differences between Legion and MLA fabbers, the case of air fabs needs to be very narrow)

Basic Metal Extractor
-Vision decreased 100 to 80
(Helps with raiding/snipes and extractors covering too much area to sneak things in)
