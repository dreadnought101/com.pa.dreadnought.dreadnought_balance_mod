Patch 1.55  Updating Lob/Starcannon + adjusting a little to the Legion changes.  Some tests on Orca+Bowhead to see if I can improve naval navigation, especially Legion.

--MLA

Commander
-Increase Commander AA AOE from 0.75 to 1.5
-No longer auto targets icarus
-[Added general PEWPEWPEW effects]

Lob (Transformed into a Unit Cannon)
-Range 240 to 480 (no orbital.  Will likely be 360 after buffed testing)
-Metal Cost 1200 to 900 (Will likely be 1200 after buffed testing)
-Vision 100 
-Health 1000 
-Metal Draw 13 to 20 (Will likely be 18 after buffed testing)
-Energy Draw 0 to 900 
-Unit Capacity 13 to 20 
-2.0 Factory roll off timer added
-Buildable Units > Skitter, Stryker, Dox, Boombot, vehicle fab, bot fab, grenadier, spinner, stinger, stitch (No Spark, Ant, Drifters, Infernos)
(I want an OP state to see what makes players hurt, and tone back to given numbers above afterwards. In terms of Unit Capacity, I will likely be buffing Starcannon and maybe the Unit Cannon to similar Lob numbers)

Drifter
-Increased idle aim delay from 3 to 5

Leveler
-Increased idle aim delay from 3 to 5

Orca
-Increases turn_accel from 15 to 60
(Some tests to improve Naval navigation)

--Legion

OmniSilo
-Energy storage increased 200,000 to 225,000
(Matches recent Legion patch)

T2 Air Stealth Scout
-Removed my own changes to update with Legion's recent base changes

Orbital Fab
-Metal Cost 1300 to 1100
-Metal build rate reduced 45 to 37
-Energy draw reduced 1500 to 1250
(Helps Legion get into Starcannon tech. Build rate reduced below 38 equivelent number as compensation)

Starcannon 
-Removed all T2 units (Fabs+Scorpion+Orbweaver)
-Removed Some T1 units (Shank, Maul)
-14 Capacity to 20
-Metal Cost reduced 2400 to 650
-Health reduced 3000 to 600
-Roll-off delay reduced 4.0 to 2.0
-Ground Vision reduced 150 to 100
-Metal Build rate 45 to 18
-Energy Draw 2250 to 700
(The cheaper cost compared to the Lob's 1200 is due to orbital launchers costing 1000, and orb fabbers at 1300.  I also feel starcannon power will be reduced over time so late game spamming isn't as big an issue)
