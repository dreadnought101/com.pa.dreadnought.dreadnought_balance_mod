Patch 1.24

~Lob (T1 Structure)
-Uses Squals (Drone) instead of Dox
Dev Idea: Turns the lob into a proper defensive structure instead of a makeshift factory.

~T2 factories. (Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval)
-Cost reduced from 4800 to 4500

~Orbital Launcher (T1 orbital constructor)
-Cost increased 600 to 1000

~Unit Cannon
-Metal cost reduced 10000 to 9500
-HP increased 18000 to 40000
Dev Idea: Increased HP to be more in line with advanced factory HP for such a significant metal investment.  Allows it to survive 1 nuke in orbital games.
