-Patch 1.29

~Commander
(Allows commander walking to be more common and push out on the map. I also want to put wall damage to 150% but WIP)
-Increased move speed from 6 to 8
-increased uber cannon damage against structures from 25% to 72% (Roughly 500 damage a shot, commander vs commander 0.25 unchanged)

~Drifter
-Increased Metal Cost 225 to 230

~Typhoon
-Increased squall launch rate from 1.8 to 2.0 (Vanilla value)

~Pelican (T1 Transport)
-Decreased metal cost from 160 to 140

~Vanguard
(Makes it so Vanguards have a better role on the frontlines of an army, but also makes them less devestating if they are inside an enemy base)
-Increased range 30 to 60
-Decreased damage from 2000 to 500 (Including splash)
-Increased fire rate from 0.5 to 1.0 (Fires 1 shot every 1 second, instead of 1 shot every 2 seconds)

~Stitch
(General combat fab buffs to help a relatively expensive unit survive a mere stray shot)
-Health increased 50 to 125

~Mend
-Health increased 150 to 350

~Slammer
-Torpedo Fire rate increased 0.25 to 0.75 (Fires three times more often)

(Under the hood dev stuff)
-Added combat tags to Icarus, Angel, Firefly, Skitter and removed combat tag from combat fabbers due to associated mods not working with this server mod.
