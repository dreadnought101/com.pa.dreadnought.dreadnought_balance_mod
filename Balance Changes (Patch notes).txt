-Patch 1.27

Narwhal and Galata AA
-Increased AA Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5
(Added AOE to overlooked AA units to be homogenized with stingers and spinners from previous patch)

Narwhal
-Health reduced 550 to 525
Narwhal
-Added AOE component to torpedo
-Radius 25
-Damage = full
(Allows T1 naval to have a sort of answer for large groups of naval units, especially submarines, but requires many narwhals or careful kiting [in which narwhals are slower than subs] in order to be effective.  The HP nerf is designed to not change orca and barracuda attacks, but to focus on air vs narwhal concerns)

Orca
-Removed AOE component of torpedo

Spark 
-Projectile lifetime decreased 1.0 to 0.55 
(Looking to add explosion at end of lifetime, so even when spark misses, it can hit something else, which at current range is a few units past the target)

Stinger
-Model size increased by 50%
-(Dev stuff) Selection Icon increased 10 to 12

Grenadier
-Model size increased by 50%

Drifter
(Dev Idea: Mostly designed around ants to survive 3 shots from drifters. HP reduced to give grenediers slightly more power against Drifters, and maintains the 2 shot kill of drifter vs drifter action)
-Damage reduced 125 to 120
-HP reduced 250 to 240

Ant
-Weapon firerate increased 0.5 to 0.55 (1 shot every 2 seconds to 1.8 seconds, 42 to 46 dps)

Orca
-AOE component of torpedos removed

Unit Cannon
-Inferno, Drifter, Skitter, Storm are now buildable
(-Testing filling out a roster for unit cannon, will look at the addition of storms and especially infernos closely)

Advanced Metal Extractor
-Metal production increased 16 to 17

Single laser turret
-Metal cost reduced 175 to 165 (Vanilla 225)
-Health decreased 350 to 325
-Vision radius (+underwater vision) reduced from 130 to 110
