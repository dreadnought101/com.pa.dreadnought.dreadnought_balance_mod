Patch 1.64

Unit Cannon
-Adjusted Pod Capacity from 1 to 100 (fixes bug with scaling up size of units for the transport system, does not affect actual gameplay)

Pelican (Air transport)
-Weight Capacity 1 to 5
-HP 100 to 225 [Vanilla 150] 
-Metal Cost 155 to 215 [Vanilla 140]
-Turn Rate increased 180 to 270
-Added load range 15 
-Added chase range 5
-Usable range 30 to 4084 (Matches Vanilla bug fix)
(Can now essentially transport naval t1 fabs/Pirhannas/Barnacles and more of T1/T2 ground units, see weights for more details)

Astraeus (Orbital Transport)
-Weight Capacity 1 to 6
-Added load range 50
-Added chase range 20
-pickup range 60 to 4048 (Matches Vanilla bug fix)
(Can now essentially transport naval Pirhannas/Barnacles/orcas/narwhals alongside pirhannas as well as T2 air fabs+Kestrels as well as carry more T1/T2 ground units, see weights for more details)

Weight for
1 - Dox/Stryker/Skitter
2 - *Grenadier/Ant/Boombot
3 - *Slammer/Gille/Bluehawk
4 - *T1 Bot/Vehicle/Air Fab/Locust/Drifter/Spinner/Stinger
5 - *T1 Naval/Barnacle/Spark/Combat Fab/Leveler/Sheller/Storm/Pirhana
8 - *Inferno/T2 Bot Fab/T2 Combat Fab/T2 Vehicle Fab/Vangaurd
(General ideas are that it doesn't change units much that are already strong like inferno+spark+vangaurd, but increases others that are weaker though fabs and AA are a higher weight class due to potential.  Will keep an eye on boombots as well) 

Orbital Launcher
-Rolloff timer decreased 3 to 2 seconds
(Allows more spam of avengers, especially when offsetting its increased cost and building size)

T1 Naval Fab
-Turn rate increased 90 to 120
