Patch 1.44

~Stingray 
Cruise Missile Lifetime reduced 60 to 15
(Dev Comment:  Massive lifetime made avoiding cruise missiles by fast air units time consuming.  This is still a long lifetime)

~Spinner 
-health reduced 160 to 130
-Speed increased from 10 to 13
-Attack speed reduced 2.4/s to 2.2 
(Dev Comment: General AA speed increases to help with non-air oponer viability with health, damage, vision nerfs as compensation)

~Stinger
-health reduced 140 to 115
-Speed increased from 10 to 14
-vision reduced 100 to 90
(Same notes as Spinner)

~T2 Radar
-Added 50 radius jamming
(Dev Comment: Allows T2 radar to have a unique impact compared to spamming T1 Radar or having orbital radar.  Also increases decision making in placement and can give consideration to building more than 1-2 of these in a game)
