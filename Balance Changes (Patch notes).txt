-Patch 1.26

(AA Changes note - Mostly for mass icarus issues, since an icarus quirk is that they bunch up its hard to click all individually in later stages when they are above 20+ the AOE will exploit it.  The AOE is not enough to affect figheters/other units in a regular box formation.)

-Increased Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

Stinger
-Increased Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5
