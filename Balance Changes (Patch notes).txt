-Patch 1.29

~Commander
(Allows commander walking to be more common and push out on the map. I also want to put wall damage to 150% but WIP)
-Increased move speed from 6 to 8
-increased uber cannon damage against structures from 25% to 72% (Roughly 500 damage a shot, commander vs commander 0.25 unchanged)

~Jig
-Explosion damage only affects structures. 
(and 0.001% damage, or 4 health points to orbital units but who's counting?)

~Orca 
(Nerfs orca torpedos dramatically so Orcas do not trade effeciently against subs but amps up anti-spam+stacking components again)
-Torpeo range decreased 145 to 140 (vanilla 150)
-Torpedo damage decreased 250 to 50
-Re-added Torpedo AOE (Full 50 damage, 10 to 25 Radius)

~Vanguard
(Makes it so Vanguards have a better role on the frontlines of an army, but also makes them less devestating if they are inside an enemy base)
-Increased range 30 to 60
-Decreased damage from 2000 to 500 (Including splash)
-Increased fire rate from 0.5 to 1.0 (Fires 1 shot every 1 second, instead of 1 shot every 2 seconds)

~Slammer
-Torpedo Fire rate increased 0.25 to 0.75 (Fires three times more often)

~Pheonix 
(I want to differentiate the T2 fighter more from its T1 counterpart, as the T2 fighter feels like a direct upgrade upgrade without its own quirks unlike most other T1 to T2 versions)
-Split Pheonix weapon from 2 firing points to 4, and added seperate sockets so each fires individually rather than in succession.
-Firerate decreased from 7.5 to 1.0 x4 (each weapon gets their own firing timer now)
-missile speed increased 150 to 250
-Bullet lifetime 2.0 to 1.5
-range increased 145 to 150 (Vanilla 120)

-(Under the hood dev stuff) "nearby_target_tick_update_interval": 0.2, (Main)
-"firing_standard_deviation": 25, (Weapon)

~Omega
>Orbital Guns (4 turrets, 2 barrels each)
-added ammo file (it currently uses the same file associated with the Anchor)
-Reduced Orbital gun range from 175 to 150 [Vanilla 150] 
-Added anti-ground/air/sea to orbital guns. [Adjusted Turret Pitch_Range from 60 to 90 in order to properly hit ground]  (Does not attack seafloor)
-Omega will prioritize other orbital units first.
-Damage 65 to 40x2 perr turret.
-Added AOE Splash component of 5x2 damage, 4 radius per turret.
>Anti-Ground Lazer
-Main anti-ground gun can now target seafloor units.
-Added auto attack component
