-Health Increased 75 to 80 [Vanilla 60]

Kraken
~Kraken torpedo weapons
-range 150 to 210
-firerate 0.6 to 0.3
-250 damage to 500
-lifetime 4 to 5s
(I wanted to give a little more dynamic power to their torpedos against vulnerable units, while simultaneously making them weaker against their sub counter, increasing their time to kill from 

Pheonix 
-Health decreased from 300 to 225 (Vanilla 240)
-Pheonix range decrease 150 to 120 [Vanilla 120]
-firerate 1.0 to 0.36 [Vanilla 0.33]
-missile speed 250 to 150 [vanilla 150]
-bullet lifetime 1.5 to 2.0 [vanilla 2.0]
(Allows them to be 3 shot by Hummingbirds, as well as revert some more experimental changes, though I'll be keeping the 4x shot in due to PAPA edits and see how it plays out)

Wyrm/Bumblebee
-Changed explosions to PBAOE 
-Added a 0.05 armor modifier against air/orbital, full for everything else.
(PBAOE is to help bombers consistently hit deep-water naval targets.  The 0.2 is PURELY for testing purposes to see if PBAOE can affect air/orbital targets and WILL be reverted)
