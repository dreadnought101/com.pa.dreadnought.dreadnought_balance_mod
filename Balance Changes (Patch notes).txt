Patch 1.51  Missile Patch

Jig 
-HP increased 3000 to 6000
-Cost decreased 4000 to 3750
(Helps pad against orbital units, especially given their recent buffs where 25 avengers were able to kill a jig in 1 pass and also don't risk Jig explosion damage.  Will still cost slightly more than an advanced metal mex per production point at 125/m vs 106/m [and T1 still at the great 24/m])

Solar Array 
-Energy Production 9000 to 11000
-health increased 6000 to 7000
(Metal cost is 5000 in my version, so gives a 2.2 ratio of metal to energy production.  Advanced energy is 1.875, and Legion's is 2.4.  The slight health buff is in response to improved orbital mechanics)

(Dev Note: I had been meaning to adjust these missiles for awhile, but the orbital speed buff has made it convenient.  The hornet, while not affecting orbital, has been too fast and will be reduced as well as my hornets being half cost/half fire-rate so overkill mechanics matter less.  Hemogenized missile stages to bluehawk stats as that does best in managing orbital dynamics fluidly)

Hornet
-Missile velocity increased 80 to 100 [Vanilla 160]
-Missile lifetimes reduced 15 to 8

Bluehawk 
-Missile velocity increased 80 to 100
-Missile lifetime reduced 15 to 8
-Missile Cruise Height increased 20 to 65
(Hopefully fixes a bug where bluehawk missiles would hover over a target, as well as allows pelicans to pick up units and dodge a missile immediately as it explodes beneath rather than circles below, allowing for specific counterplay with pickup/drops)

Catapult 
-Metal 2000 to 1750
-Health 1500 to 1000
-Missile velocity increased 80 to 100
-Missile lifetime reduced 15 to 8
-Firerate 0.4 to 0.2857 (Fires once every 3.5 seconds instead of 2.5)
(Helps discourage constant catapult spam, but also allows for more strategic positions to be built with a metal cost reduction, and perhaps a vehicle push counter strategy)

Stingray
-Missile velocity increased 80 to 100
-Missile lifetime reduced 15 to 8
-Missile turn rate 0 to 45
-Missile damage increased 1000 to 1250
(5 to 4 shot typhoon and 6 to 5 leviathan.  Does not change 4 shot omega nor 3 shot wyrm)

Umbrella 
-Bullet Velocity increased 1000 to 1250
-Lifetime 3 to 2.4

Basic Vehicle Fab
-Speed increased 12 to 13
(Dev Note: Gives vehicle 1st openers slightly better viability. Bot speed is still 16, and metal cost 150 vs 200 for distinct differences.  May increase energy drain or reduce health of vehicle fabs slightly.)
