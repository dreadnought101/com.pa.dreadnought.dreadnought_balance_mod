Patch 1.48

T3 Turret
-Firerate 4.5 to 3.5 [Vanilla 5.0]
-damage 175 to 200 [Vanilla 150]
-Health decreased 3750 to 3500 [Vanilla 4000]
(Dev Note:Not a fan of the T2 turret obsoleting the other turrets with both its fire-rate and damage. Encourages players to invest in a comprehensive turret line to handle swarms of units.  Would like T2 turrets to be more tanky as well compared to T3) 

Drifter
-Health decreased 240 to 225 [Vanilla 250]

~Narwhal
-Torpedo Launchers
-  -100 to 150 damage [Vanilla 250]
-  -225 to 150 range [Vanilla 150]
-  -0.2 to 0.4 firerate [Vanilla 0.4]
-  -7 to 5 Lifetime [Vanilla 5]
(Reverting experimental torpedo changes)

T1 naval fab 
-Move speed increased 10 to 12
(Dev Note: Allows for faster openings to cut down on the slow nature of early naval, as well as be less punishing when killing fabs that are far away from a factory spawn point)

T2 Naval fab
Changed T2 naval fab from deepwater to water-hover (Dev Note: movespeed 10 unchanged.  The water-hover change is for pure quality of life in building on land and will likely have little impact on balance)
