~Firefly (T1 Air Scout)
-Added Radar Stealth 

~Skitter (T1 Vehicle Scout)
-Added Radar Stealth

~Hummingbird (T1 Air Fighter)
-reduced damage from 80 to 75.
Dev Idea: Allows for easier partial heals from damage for both fireflies and Pheonix and reduces Fireflies impact slightly on heavy health T2 Air and Titan.  May change to 70 which will have more significant ramifications for air fights.

~Stryker (T1 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: Gives them more dart in-dart out mechanics, changes up the gameplay between them and dox and against other units)

~Ant (T1 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: Matches spark vision and better supports high range+low vision units)
-Vision radius increased 100 to 130

~Drifter (T1 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: Mostly designed around ants to survive 3 shots from drifters. HP reduced to give grenediers slightly more power against Drifters, and maintains the 2 shot kill of drifter vs drifter action)
-Damage reduced 125 to 120
-HP reduced 250 to 240

~Spinner (T1 Vehicle)
-Increased Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

-Acceleration decreased from 180 to 50
-Move Speed increased 19 to 20
-Weapon Muzzle Velocity Increased 130 to 135

...kidding.
-build cost increased 260 metal to 265

~Colonel (T2 Bot)

~Hornet (T2 Air bomber)
-range increase 180 to 200
-vision radius increase 200 to 210
-underwater vision radius 200 to 210

~Horsefly (T2 Air strafer)
(Dev Idea: The AA component is mostly for taking out slow, wide-hitbox targets like hornets, wyrms, angels, and other horseflies.  Horseflies also have potency against Zues Titans now)
-Added Anti-Air component to flak cannon [Prioritises Anti-Air ground units first]
-Changed air damage modifier from 0.5 to 1.0 [Horseflies do full damage vs air]

~Piranha (T1 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Piranhas with torpedo changes lock down shorelines even against defense structures and grenediar/drifter retakes, this will reduce that power but increase their early game presence in naval engagements and raiding, metal increase is to slightly slow down overwhelming an opponent)
-range decreased 120 to 110
-metal cost increased 150 to 160
-damage increased 20 to 24

~Barracuda (T1 Naval)
-No Longer has radar stealth

~Narwhal (T1 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Allows for air to play better around Narwhals but doesn't punish players for building narwhals early and getting caught out by early naval aggression.  Added weak but long range torpedo launchers to give it a small bit of presence against orcas+subs)
-Vision+underwater increased 180 to 200
-Health reduced 750 to 525
-Metal cost decreased 450 to 350

-Added Torpedo Launchers
- -50 damage
- -225 range
- -25 AOE radius (full damage)
- -0.2 Firerate (fires 1 shot every 5.00 seconds)
- -Velocity 5.0 (same speed as barracuda/orca)
- -Lifetime 7 (how long the torpedo lasts before fizzling out)

~Orca (T1 Naval)
-Removed AOE component of torpedo weapon

~Barnacle (T1 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Quality of life changes to let the Barnacle's speed match Orcas/Narwhals at 11 and allows it to repair more safely and consistently.  Extra note, build range may be to big but want to try something extreme, will likely be 90 after)
-speed increased 10 to 11
-build range increased 65 to 120

-Stingray (T2 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Gives naval units an answer to the long range hornet, as well as more potent damage against wyrms and horseflies)
Added Anti-Air component to cruise missile [No priority]

~Atlas (Titan)
(Dev Idea: General buffs to health but makes them slightly less devestating when they reach your frontline, would love to give more options of attacking later)

-full Damage radius decreased 80 to 60
-splash damage raidus decreased 135 to 120 (damage still 8000)

-secondary weapons range increased 220 to 350
-secondary weapons velocity increased 140 to 225
-secondary weapons lifetime increased 3.0 to 4.5

~Typhoon (T2 Naval)

-Squal launchrate 2.0/s to 1.8/s

~Omega (Advanced Orbital)
(Dev Idea: Make them actually counter avengers)
-cost reduced 14000 to 12500
-Add splash to anti-orbital weapons (2x65 damage every 1.00 seconds)

-Metal cost increased 1600 to 5000
-Energy production increased 2500/s to  9000/s
-Added 100,000 energy storage (from 0)

~Jig (Orbital Gas Giant Extractor)
(Dev Idea: Refocuse orbital energy production to Solar Arrays, Jigs cover to many roles and are strong for their value)
-Removed 50,000 energy storage (to 0)
-Removed 7,500 energy production (to 0)

~Energy Storage
(Decrease cost so its easier to build earlier on and increase storage amount to be impactful)

-Range decreased 100 to 90
-Damage decreased 40 to 35
-Vision radius (+underwater vision) reduced from 130 to 110

~Lob (T1 Defense Structure)
-Uses Squals (Drone) instead of Dox
Dev Idea: Turns the lob into a proper defensive structure instead of a makeshift factory.  Will likely change squal's effectivness or cost soon.

~Advanced Laser Defense Tower (T2 Defense Structure - triple barrel)
(Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 875
-Range increased 120 to 140

-Metal cost reduced 10000 to 9500
-HP increased 18000 to 40000
(Dev Idea: -Increased HP to be more in line with advanced factory HP for such a significant metal investment.  Allows it to survive 1 nuke in orbital games. Will try to make it buildable on water later.
-Testing filling out a roster for unit cannon, will look at the addition of storms and especially infernos closely)

-All Advanced Fabricators [Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval] can now build all types of Titans [Atlas/Ares/Zues]
(Dev Idea: Quality of life change, most players just relied on orbital fabs to build the desired titan)
