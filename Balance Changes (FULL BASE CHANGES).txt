FULL BASE CHANGES  (Changes from current base game) [Updated as of patch 1151447]

~Firefly (T1 Air Scout)
(Dev note: Rewards lone positioning and scouting in mid to late game)
-Added Radar Stealth 

~Skitter (T1 Vehicle Scout)
(Dev notes~The movespeed buff allows skitters when built before the first fabs to reach the enemy base on small, and some medium maps before an air scout and icarus can be built and makes a ground only opener struggle.
~the health increase is to tank a shot from dox or strykers [they fire 2, so its only for partial hits],
~the metal cost is to bring it below the firefly, and between dox and stryker.
~Overall buffs to skitters are generally risk free due to the utility, non-combat nature of this unit and I want to reward positioning and scouting after the early game.)
-Added Radar Stealth
-Move speed 25 to 32
-Metal cost 75 to 55
-Health 10 to 15

~Hummingbird (T1 Air Fighter)
-reduced damage from 80 to 75.
Dev Idea: Allows for easier partial heals from damage for both fireflies and Pheonix and reduces Fireflies impact slightly on heavy health T2 Air and Titan.  May change to 70 which will have more significant ramifications for air fights.

~Pelican (T1 Transport)
(Transports are a utility based unit, and are difficult to use and mass up in most parts of the game. I am concerned with their early game potential in rushing, so I am starting with a smaller tweak first.)
-Decreased metal cost from 160 to 140

~Stryker (T1 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: Gives them more dart in-dart out mechanics, changes up the gameplay between them and dox and against other units)
-Health decreased 60 to 50
-Range decreased 80 to 75
-Damage decreased 15x2 to 13x2
-Movement Speed Increased 18 to 20
-Weapon Muzzle Velocity Decreased 140 to 135

~Ant (T1 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: Matches spark vision and better supports high range+low vision units)
(-Ants a long time ago had a turn rate of 90. I intend to do 105, but want to see how this old, more predictive type of micro handles in the modern era. At the moment I believe ants are too responsive and reactive for the lumbering tank persona, and in gameplay terms they are good at kiting backwards quickly and I want to see if this helps fast units+projectiles catch out ants better)
-Turn rate decreased 120 to 90
-Vision radius increased 100 to 130
-Weapon firerate increased 0.5 to 0.525 (1 shot every 2 seconds to 1.9 seconds, 42 to 44 dps)

~Drifter (T1 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: Mostly designed around ants to survive 3 shots from drifters. HP reduced to give grenediers slightly more power against Drifters, and maintains the 2 shot kill of drifter vs drifter action.  Overall goal is to make them less able to operate alone, and be more reliant on support units)
-Metal cost increased 225 to 230
-HP reduced 250 to 240
-Damage reduced 125 to 120
-Bullet velocity decreased 150 to 140
-Vision range reduced 100 to 90

~Spinner (T1 Vehicle)
-Increased Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

~Dox (T1 Bot)
(Dev Idea: Allows for more smooth micro and dox will have near 100% uptime when heavily microd)
-Acceleration decreased from 180 to 50
-Move Speed increased 19 to 20
-Weapon Muzzle Velocity Increased 130 to 135

~Grenadier (T1 Bot)
(Dev Idea: Makes Grenadiers less spammy in both unit amounts and how often they fire, and make their shots matter more against large or static units, and less powerful against small, fast units)
-Metal cost increased 100 to 150
-HP increased 80 to 120
-Vision range reduced 100 to 90
-Model size increased by 30%
~Main Weapon
- -Firerate decreased 2.00 to 4.20 seconds
- -dps increased from roughly 40 to 57
- -Fires 4 shots instead of 2 a volley
- -Damage increased 40x2 to 60x4
- -Splash damage increased 30x2 to 24x4
- -Full damage splash radius reduced 2 to 0.75
- -Partial damage splash radius reduced 5 to 2.0
-Torpedo Weapon added (Attacks water units, excluding hover units)
- -Damage 50
- -Firerate 0.5 (Fires 1 shot every 2 seconds)
- -Range 60
- -Land speed Velocity 70
- - Water speed Velocity 40

~Spark (T1 Bot)
(Dev Idea: Decrease range allows for more micro opportunities for strykers+dox to play around Sparks but still makes sparks strong if unmicrod.  Also allows ants+drifters more control against them)
-Decreased range 70 to 65
-Vision increased 120 to 130
-Projectile lifetime decreased 1.0 to 0.55

~Stinger (T1 AA Bot)
(Dev Idea: Alternate approach to anti-air with higher range and more upfront damage but lower dps overall.)
~HP 130 to 140
~Metal Cost 120 to 140
~Move Speed 12 to 10
~Vision 100 (same)
~Range 90 to 180
~Damage 30 damage to 95
~Rate of Fire 1.0 reduced to 0.33 (1 shot every 1 second to every 3 seconds)
~Added splash damage with radius of 1.5 and 35 damage
~DPS 30 dps to 32
~Bullet lifetime increase 1.0 to 1.1
~Model size increased by 50%
(Stinger selection icon Increased from 10 to 12)

~Locust (T2 Bot)
-Deleted from the game
...kidding.
-build cost increased 260 metal to 265

~Colonel (T2 Bot)
-Metal cost reduced 7000 to 6500

~Leveler (T2 Vehicle)
(I think the leveler range is fine for MLA specifically, but I'm interested in balancing bugs and legion, and find levelers to be downright insane against them. Additionally this will help grenadiers counter levelers with a range difference as was seen with 145 to 140 ratio, and also accounts for my own metal+unit size increases that changes this matchup)
-Range 140 to 130

~Storm (T2 Vehicle)
(Dev Idea: takes 3 shots to kill bombers instead of 2, but increase range for more coverage and utility for larger armies present in later stages of game)
-range increased 100 to 120
-damage decreased 4x15 to 4x10
-Splash decreased 10 to 7
-velocity increased 100 to 120
-lifetime increased 15 to 18

~Vanguard (T2 Vehicle)
-Radar increased 260 to 300
-Jamming removed

~Pheonix (T2 Air Fighter)
-range increased 120 to 145
-damage decreased 150 to 50
-rate of fire increased 0.33 to 0.15 (fires 7.5 shots per second instead of 3)
Dev Idea: Experimental changes. Will likely revert or reduce.

~Hornet (T2 Air bomber)
(Gives some small buffs to ease this paper-plane into prominence)
-range increase 180 to 200
-vision radius increase 200 to 210
-underwater vision radius 200 to 210
-Health increased 200 to 250

~Horsefly (T2 Air strafer)
(Dev Idea: The AA component is mostly for taking out slow, wide-hitbox targets like hornets, wyrms, angels, and other horseflies.  Horseflies also have potency against Zues Titans now)
-Added Anti-Air component to flak cannon [Prioritises Anti-Air ground units first]
-Changed air damage modifier from 0.5 to 1.0 [Horseflies do full damage vs air]

~Naval Basic Fabricator
(Dev note: The naval fab has less health than the vehicle fab at 200, despite costing more, having less speed, and more threatening enemy units, not to mention T2 naval fab has more health than T2 vehicle)
-Health increased 100 to 200

~Piranha (T1 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Piranhas with torpedo changes lock down shorelines even against defense structures and grenediar/drifter retakes, this will reduce that power but increase their early game presence in naval engagements and raiding, metal increase is to slightly slow down overwhelming an opponent)
-range decreased 120 to 110
-metal cost increased 150 to 160
-damage increased 20 to 24

~Barracuda (T1 Naval)
-No Longer has radar stealth

~Narwhal (T1 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Allows for air to play better around Narwhals but doesn't punish players for building narwhals early and getting caught out by early naval aggression.  Added weak but long range torpedo launchers to give it a small bit of presence against orcas+subs)
-Vision+underwater increased 180 to 200
-Health reduced 750 to 525
-Metal cost decreased 450 to 350
-AA Weapon firerate 3.0/s to 2.4/s
-AA Weapon damage decerased 25 to 20
-AA Weapon AOE radius increased from 0.75 to 1.5
-Added Torpedo Launchers
- -100 damage
- -225 range
- -0.2 Firerate (fires 1 shot every 5.00 seconds)
- -Velocity 5.0 (same speed as barracuda/orca)
- -Lifetime 7 (how long the torpedo lasts before fizzling out)

~Orca (T1 Naval)
-Removed AOE component of torpedo weapon

~Barnacle (T1 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Quality of life changes to let the Barnacle's speed match Orcas/Narwhals at 11 and allows it to repair more safely and consistently.  Extra note, build range may be to big but want to try something extreme, will likely be 90 after)
-speed increased 10 to 11
-build range increased 65 to 120

-Stingray (T2 Naval)
(Dev Idea: Gives naval units an answer to the long range hornet, as well as more potent damage against wyrms and horseflies)
-Added Anti-Air component to cruise missile [No priority]
-Increased AA-weapon (not cruise weapon) splash radius from 0.75 to 1.5

~Atlas (Titan)
(Dev Idea: General buffs to health but makes them slightly less devestating when they reach your frontline, would love to give more options of attacking later)
-Health increased 40000 to 60000
-full Damage radius decreased 80 to 60
-splash damage raidus decreased 135 to 120 (damage still 8000)

~ARES (Titan)
(Dev Idea: Makes killing it easier, and gives a real use to secondary guns)
-Health decreased 80000 to 40000
-main guns
- -Primary AOE radius reduced 5 to 2
- -Partial AOE radius reduced 15 to 2
-secondary weapons 
- -Range increased 220 to 360
- -Firerate increased 0.7 to 1.0 a second
- -Projectile speed increased 140 to 225 
- -Projectile lifetime increased 3.0 to 4.5
- -(Turret pitch range increased 15 to 45 to help     turret utilize full range)

~Astraeus
(Intended to change capacity from 1 to 5. Despite actually working, was causing problems and was clunky. Health buff is a leftover change that makes it so air takes 3 shots to snipe an astraeus instead of 2)
-health 150 to 225

~Omega (Advanced Orbital Battleship)
(Dev Idea: Make them actually counter avengers)
-cost reduced 14000 to 12500

~Stitch (combat fab)
(Lets them take 2 stray shots from grenadier and slightly bulks up the unit but is still fragile to most things directly)
-Increased health from 50 to 65

~Mend (Adv combat fab)
(General combat fab buffs to help a relatively expensive unit survive a mere stray shot. Barnacles and Angels do not fall under this concern)
-Health increased from 150 to 325

~Advanced Fabricators [Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval] 
(Dev Idea: Quality of life change, most players just relied on orbital fabs to build the desired titan)
(Dev Note: Metal cost reduced rougly 10% across the board, more favoring naval, slightly less favoring bot)
~Bot - 1800 to 1650
~Vehicle - 2025 to 1850
~Air - 2200 to 2000
~Naval - 2400 to 2150
~Each can now build all types of Titans [Atlas/Ares/Zues]

~Solar Array (Advanced Orbital energy producer)
(Dev Idea: Solar-power is GREEN! and best!  Basically this is the T3 energy producer, much like the Jig)
-HP Increase 1000 to 6000
-Metal cost increased 1600 to 5000
-Energy production increased 2500/s to  9000/s
-Added 100,000 energy storage (from 0)

~Jig (Orbital Gas Giant Extractor)
(Dev Idea: Refocuse orbital energy production to Solar Arrays, Jigs cover to many roles and are strong for their value)
-Removed 50,000 energy storage (to 0)
-Removed 7,500 energy production (to 0)
-Jig Explosion mainly affects buildings (units take 4 damage, structures take 4000)

~Energy Storage
(Decrease cost so its easier to build earlier on and increase storage amount to be impactful)
-HP Reduced from 7500 to 5000
-Metal Cost reduced 450 to 250
-Storage increased 100,000 to 250,000

Advanced Metal Extractor (T2 Economy)
-Metal Cost reduced 2000 to 1800
-Metal production increased 16 to 17

~Galata (T1 AA structure)
-Increased AA Splash Radius from 0.75 to 1.5

~Single Laser Defense Tower (1 barrel)
(Dev Idea: Adds more support against dox/strykers early game but is vulnerable to stronger T1 units, now 2 shots dox like it 2 shots strykers)
-Metal Cost decreased 225 to 165
-Range decreased 100 to 90
-Damage decreased 40 to 35
-Vision radius (+underwater vision) reduced from 130 to 110

~Lob (T1 Defense Structure)
-Uses Squals (Drone) instead of Dox
Dev Idea: Turns the lob into a proper defensive structure instead of a makeshift factory.  Will likely change squal's effectivness or cost soon.

~Advanced Laser Defense Tower (T2 Defense Structure - triple barrel)
(Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 875
-Range increased 120 to 140
-Health increased 4000 to 4250

~Flak Cannon (T2)
(Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)
-HP reduced 2000 to 1700
-Metal cost reduced 900 to 750
-Range increased 120 to 150

~Advanced Torpedo Launcher (T2)
(Dev Idea: General T2 defense buffs)
-metal cost reduced 1000 to 950
-range increased 210 to 300
-Rate of fire decreased 2.5 to 2.0/s
-torpedo lifetime increased 5 to 7
-Vision radius increased from 210 to 260
-Underwater vision radius increased 200 to 260
-Radar radius increased 210 to 310
-Sonar radius increased 210 to 310

~T2 factories. (Vehicle/Bot/Air/Naval)
(Dev Note: I'm looking to have factories work better on their own without having to rely heavily on boosting, but not remove that mechanic entirely. I want to give players a reason to build multiple T2 factories, at least on medium and large maps)

-All Advanced Factory costs reduced from 4800 to 4400

Adv Bot Factory
-Metal Build Rate increased 45 to 60
Energy draw per second 1500 to 1800
30 energy per metal
Roll off timer increased 3 seconds to 5

Adv Vehicle Factory
Metal build rate (60) unchanged
Energy 2025 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 4 to 6.5

Adv Air Factory
Metal 45 to 60
Energy 1500 to 1800
30 E/M
Roll off time - 2 to 5

Adv Naval Factory
Metal 60 to 72
Energy 1750 to 2015
28 E/M
Roll off time - 6 to 9

~Orbital Launcher (T1)
-Cost increased 600 to 1000

~Orbital Factory
(The reduction is quite high, but still accounts for 1000 launcher, and 1300 orbital fab, and the units themselves are mostly cost-prohibitive to get early. I'm hesitant to reduce it all the way to 3600 though)
-Cost reduced 6000 to 4000

~Unit Cannon (T2 Launcher Factory)
-Metal cost reduced 10000 to 7200
-HP increased 18000 to 40000
-Drifters, Infernos, Storms, 
(Dev Idea: -Increased HP to be more in line with advanced factory HP for such a significant metal investment.  Allows it to survive 1 nuke in orbital games. Will try to make it buildable on water later.
(-Testing filling out a roster for unit cannon, will look at the addition of storms and especially infernos closely)
